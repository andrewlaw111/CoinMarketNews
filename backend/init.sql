The platform was later released as open source software under the Apache 2 license in October of 2016.\nDragonchain simplifies the integration of real business applications on a blockchain and provides features such as easy integration, protection of business data and operations, currency agnosticism, and multi-currency support.\nThe Dragonchain Foundation, a Non-Profit Corporation was created in January of 2017 to maintain ownership and responsibility of the open source code.\nThe Dragonchain team is now in the process of launching a commercial entity to build a serverless architecture blockchain platform. The combination of serverless and blockchain technologies is unique and tremendously valuable. The timing of the Dragonchain platform launch is highly strategic to benefit from explosive growth of cloud computing over the last few years and the emerging wave of Blockchain solutions entering proof of concept stage across enterprises.\nThe Dragonchain team will launch Dragonchain, Inc., as a commercial entity to provide an array of products and services to the community. Our vision supports areas of the market that are underserved with strong demand and projected growth in the blockchain industry ($7.7b by 2024) across an array of multi-billion dollar sectors such as Arts, Wine, Automotive, Legal, Digital Marketing, etc. These sectors and more will experience market disruption with blockchain capabilities shifting the value proposition into decentralized environments. Dragonchain platform will support these needs.\nDragonchain provides a commercial platform for application developers to rapidly and securely deploy Blockchain applications while maintaining existing language development environments (e.g. Java, Python, Node, C#, Go); a tremendous costing and speed to market advantage. The Dragonchain architecture is also designed to allow nodes to handle approval of transactions based upon five levels of network consensus to provide a spectrum of trust to data consumers; a level of security and flexibility unseen in the market by current blockchain solution providers. These design attributes position Dragonchain for exponential growth.\nIn addition, Dragonchain will provide project incubation as well as professional services with strategic partnerships to develop successful tokenization ecosystems focusing on long term value.\nA DRGN is a tokenized micro-license for interaction with Dragonchain commercial platform services which captures legal guidance regarding US Securities law.

Each account has its own blockchain (account-chain), equivalent to the account’s transaction/balance history. Each account-chain can only be updated by the account’s owner; this allows each account-chain to be updated immediately and asynchronously to the rest of the block-lattice, resulting in quick transactions. Since blocks can only be added by each account-chain’s owner, transferring funds from one account to another requires two transactions: a send transaction deducting the amount from the sender’s balance and a receive transaction adding the amount to the receiving account’s balance.

A multi-tier blockchain system designed to address unsolved questions of scalability, privacy, and interoperability in blockchain networks.\nThe Aion blockchain network is like a computer network that makes it possible for dissimilar systems to communicate. \nThe Aion network will pass logic and value among participating blockchains as freely as liquid assets, where every transaction occurs without centralized intermediaries.\nThe Aion network will be centered on a public, purpose-built third-generation blockchain called Aion-1. Designed to connect other blockchains and manage its own robust applications, Aion-1 also provides the crypto-economic system that incentivizes interoperability in the ecosystem.\nThe AION token is initially being offered on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token. As soon as the Aion network is operational, these ERC-20 tokens can be seamlessly converted to AION network tokens, and will continue to be able to flow freely back and forth between these two blockchains.\nThe AION token is the fundamental method of interaction within the Aion network and its primary currency, powering:\nAION-1 OPERATIONS: Mechanics of the Aion-1 blockchain are powered by the AION token, including the ability for users to stake tokens to back validators of Aion’s consensus process.\nBLOCKCHAIN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS: Developing applications on Aion-1 requires the use of AION tokens to access the resources of Aion Virtual Machine. Based on the complexity of the application, the AVM consumes tokens as fuel.\nINTER-CHAIN BRIDGES: In order to instantiate a bridge from Aion-1 to any participating blockchain, AION tokens must be staked into a bridge registry contract. Once built, other nodes can join the bridge by also staking AION tokens. Fees for inter-chain transactions are set by bridges, and distributed to the validators on those bridges.\nPARTICIPATING BLOCKCHAINS: AION tokens can be used to access and create customized Aion-compatible participating blockchains.

763	0x	ZRX	33	532475274	1000000000	\N	1530157158	1896	At its core, 0x is an open and non-rent seeking protocol that facilitates trustless, low friction exchange of Ethereum-based assets. Developers can use 0x as a platform to build exchange applications on top of (0x.js is a Javascript library for interacting with the 0x protocol). For end users, 0x will be the infrastructure of a wide variety of user-facing applications i.e. 0x Portal, a decentralized application that facilitates trustless trading of Ethereum-based tokens between known counterparties.\nIn the two years since the Ethereum blockchain’s genesis block, numerous decentralized applications (dApps) have created Ethereum smart contracts for peer-to-peer exchange. Rapid iteration and a lack of best practices have left the blockchain scattered with proprietary and application-specific implementations. As a result, end users are exposed to numerous smart contracts of varying quality and security, with unique configuration processes and learning curves, all of which implement the same functionality. This approach imposes unnecessary costs on the network by fragmenting end users according to the particular dApp each user happens to be using, eliminating valuable network effects around liquidity. 0x is the solution to this problem by acting as modular, unopinionated building blocks that may be assembled and reconfigured.\n0x protocol token (ZRX) is utilized in two ways: 1) to solve the coordination problem and drive network effects around liquidity, creating a feedback loop where early adopters of the protocol benefit from wider adoption and 2) to be used for decentralized governance over 0x protocol's update mechanism. In more detail:\nZRX tokens are used by Makers and Takers (market participants that generate and consume orders, respectively) to pay transaction fees to Relayers (entities that host and maintain public order books).\nZRX tokens are used for decentralized governance over 0x protocol’s update mechanism which allows its underlying smart contracts to be replaced and improved over time. An update mechanism is needed because 0x is built upon Ethereum’s rapidly evolving technology stack, decentralized governance is needed because 0x protocol’s smart contracts will have access to user funds and numerous dApps will need to plug into 0x smart contracts. Decentralized governance ensures that this update process is secure and minimizes disruption to the network.

503	Maker	MKR	38	618228	1000000	\N	1530157153	1518	MKR is a token that has a volatile price because of its unique supply mechanics and role on the Maker platform. MKR is a utility token, governance token and recapitalization resource of the Maker system.\nAs a utility token, MKR is required for paying the fees accrued on CDPs that have been used to generate Dai in the Maker system. Only MKR can pay these fees, and when paid the MKR is burned, removing it from the supply. This means that if the adoption and demand for Dai and CDPs increases, there will be additional demand for MKR so users can pay the fees. It also means the supply will decrease as MKR is burned.\nAs a governance token, MKR is used by MKR holders to vote for the risk management and business logic of the Maker system. Risk management is crucial for the systems success and survival, and is done in practice by voting on specific risk parameters for each collateral asset and CDP type. The risk parameters need to be set rigorously to correspond to the risk profile of the collateral assets used by the CDPs in the system, and determine factors such as how much extra collateral is required for generating Dai with the collateral asset, or how much Dai can be backed in total by a specific collateral asset.\nThe voting process for the governance of the system is done through continuous approval voting. This means every MKR holder can vote for any number of proposals with the MKR he holds, and can submit a new proposal, or cast or withdraw his votes at any point in time. The proposal that has the most votes from all MKR holders becomes the “top proposal” and can be activated to implement changes to the risk parameters of the system. There is a security delay after the proposal is activated, before its changes are implemented, in order to give the community enough time to react and prevent malicious proposals from damaging the system.\nThe initial governance framework for Dai risk management will be using the Sunday meetings to spread awareness around new proposals, and coordinate votes. Based on the experience learned in governing Dai we will work together in the community to come up with a holistic framework for future governance of the scale that the system will need in the long run. There will be a simple dapp available that allows any MKR holder to easily vote with their MKR by using metamask, mist or parity. More advanced features are planned for the future, such as delegating your votes to a proxy voter, and the ability to safely vote with MKR held in cold storage.\nIf MKR holders are highly competent and govern the system well, CDPs will always remain overcollateralized and there will be no threat of insolvency to the system. However mistakes or unforeseen circumstances can happen, and as a result it is possible that parts of the collateral portfolio becomes undercollateralized. When this happens the last function of the MKR token is triggered: automatic recapitalization through forced MKR dilution. This means that the Maker system automatically creates new MKR tokens and sells them on the market, instantly raising money to recapitalize the shortfall of value in the system and bring it back from insolvency. This means that MKR holders are held directly accountable for their actions, since bad governance will result in their tokens becoming diluted.

Ardor extends Nxt for use in certain applications that require scalability and want to avoid “mining” required by some developing blockchains.\nThere are two parts to the Ardor Platform—the Ardor main chain and child chains that are the distinct blockchains created for business with use-specific features and applications.\nThe Ardor main chain is the blockchain that will secure all of the child chains and process their transactions. Some transactions will take place on the Ardor main blockchain like the exchange of the Ardor token (ARDR) from one account to another.\nThe features on the Ardor main blockchain are limited to improve performance and to reduce the blockchain bloat that occurs with the accumulated storage of information.\nArdor is 100% Proof-of-Stake so no additional processing will be needed for mining as all tokens have already been created.

Introduced as a "joke currency" on 6 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014.\nCompared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined. While there are few mainstream commercial applications, the currency has gained traction as an Internet tipping system, in which social media users grant Dogecoin tips to other users for providing interesting or noteworthy content.

Vertcoin (VTC) stays true to the original vision of cryptocurrency: a financial system owned by its users, the people’s coin. Vertcoin is not controlled by large banks or mining hardware manufacturers and can be mined by anyone profitably. Fairly distributed without a premine, ICO or airdrop, Vertcoin is developed by community members working as volunteers and the project is wholly funded by donations. A finite resource similar to gold, you can rest assured that Vertcoin will keep your money safe from vested interests and ensure that transaction fees are proportionate and shared between a large number of miners. With Vertcoin, you can truly be your own bank.\nVertcoin’s algorithm is designed to resist the development of custom mining hardware and multipool mining, ensuring that transactions are validated by a widely distributed network and avoiding the selling pressure when large mining pools indiscriminately flood the market with freshly mined coins. Our developers have pledged to take whatever steps are necessary to protect this coin from specialized mining equipment and make sure that it will always be possible to mine with consumer grade hardware. This is great news for miners because it offers the opportunity for all miners to compete fairly with each other, and not have to risk falling victim to unscrupulous hardware manufacturers who may fail to deliver pre-ordered equipment.

These problems are limited performance, lack of resource segregation, and a properly working governance model. By resolving these issues, aelf will be bringing blockchain technology into business scenarios with full force.\nIn response to this, they have created a blockchain which can be integrated to side chain specific business scenarios. The aelf blockchain and sidechains will possess the following qualities:\n- High efficiency and scalability to handle transactions/applications at a commercial scale\n- High flexibility to customize Smart Contracts to meet the needs of different industries\n- High adaptability to new technology in the future\n- High compatibility to allow communication across public and private Chains and existing Blockchains\naelf was originally launched as Grid, however due to confusion with a similar project called Grid+, it was rebranded as aelf late November 2017. Another confusion which was cleared up early in aelf’s life was the complete separation from the Polkadot project.

It is the first decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage that uses blockchain technology and cryptography to secure your files.\nStorj is a platform, cryptocurrency, and suite of decentralized applications that allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are encrypted, shredded into little pieces called 'shards', and stored in a decentralized network of computers around the globe. No one but you has a complete copy of your file, not even in an ecrypted form.\nBecause of this, Storj can be faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional cloud storage platforms. Faster because multiple machines are serving you your file simultaneously, cheaper because you are renting people's spare hard-drive space instead of paying for a purpose-built data center, and more secure because your file is both encrypted and shredded. There is no need to trust a corporation, vulnerable servers, or employees with your files. Storj completely removes trust from the equation.\nStorj uses blockchain features like a transaction ledger, public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions for security.\nStorj is working hard to solve data security issues with the help of its own web app, Storj, which lets you store your files, and client app, Storj Share, which lets you rent your hard-drive space for money.\nTo best protect your data, files are encrypted client-side on your computer before they are uploaded. Each file is split up into chunks which are first encrypted and then distributed for storage across the Storj network. The network is comprised of Storj Share nodes run by users around the world who rent out their unused hard drive space in return for Storj Token (STORJ).\nThe decentralized aspect of Storj means there are no central servers to be compromised, and with client-side encryption, your are in control of the keys to your files.

Zilliqa has been under research and development for two years. It brings the theory of sharding to practice with its novel protocol that increases transaction rates as its network expands.\nZilliqa processes more transactions per second as more mining nodes join the network. This may sound like a natural thing at first, but it turns out to be technically challenging to accomplish, and certainly hasn’t been possible by past blockchain protocols. Getting consensus in a larger crowd is technically harder! Zilliqa’s novel consensus protocol solves this problem. With Zilliqa’s scalability, we can support dApps that demand transaction rates beyond today’s blockchains.\nZilliqa only leverages PoW to establish mining identities. This process defends against sybil attacks and is also used to perform network sharding. Unlike other blockchains though, Zilliqa does not use PoW for consensus. PoW is performed only at larger intervals, not by every miner on every block. Thus, it has a much smaller energy footprint. We’ve stayed with PoW since it has been well studied in the literature and field-tested, while its emerging alternatives (such as PoS) are still under active research.

With Reddcoin, you are essentially your own bank.\nReddcoin is dedicated to one thing – tipping on social networks as a way to bring cryptocurrency awareness and experience to the general public. Social networks are now part of our everyday lives. They give every person on this planet a fair chance at showing the world how awesome they are. Getting an upvote, like, or retweet for your well-received comment or picture is fun, but unfortunately, they have no real value. Fortunately, there is now something better than imaginary internet points – Reddcoins.\nCryptocurrencies are complicated. Let’s face it – the average person has no idea how cryptocurrencies works. They would like to get involved, but usually have no idea where to start. Reddcoin's objective is to fill those voids by integrating a seamless cryptocurrency tipping system with all major social networks to make the process of exchanging coins simple, fun, and rewarding both for the giver and the receiver.\nReddcoin was conceived to be a full-fledged social network coin - the Social Currency. The developers are currently building a hub that will manage the various social media tipping accounts that will be created on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc. The plan is to make Reddcoin into a hybrid of e-currency/crypto, reward points, etc. Basically, Reddcoin will be internet points with actual monetary value. Already, tipping has been enabled on Twitter, Twitch, and Justin.TV, as well as here on Reddit.\nThe idea is to have a system that makes it easy for people and businesses to auto-tip people, re-posts, etc. Then people can use their Reddcoins on websites to purchase items or use them in games like Freemium games in place of purchasing in-game credits. This would benefit businesses, developers, and users alike. If you buy credits in-game or for a specific site, you're stuck to using them in only that place. With Reddcoins, you could potentially use them any number of places, helping ease fears over purchasing game or site credits.\nThe plan for Reddcoin is to essentially be the internet's official "like" button. Can you imagine being tipped on Instagram for your picture upload, on Facebook for your location check-in, on YouTube for a silly video you uploaded, on Reddit for your witty comment, etc.? Now imagine being able to exchange those Reddcoins instantly for physical goods or gift cards. Or even transferring all your Reddcoins to a game you love playing. You would be getting paid for things that take zero effort or that you are probably already doing for free anyway.

It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator. The network is peer-to-peer and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was invented by an unknown person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009.\nBitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoin as payment. Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there are 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.

It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction based state transitions. In popular discourse, the term Ethereum is often used interchangeably with Ether to refer to the cryptocurrency that is generated on the Ethereum platform.\nEther is a cryptocurrency whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum platform. Ether can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant mining nodes for computations performed. Ethereum provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. "Gas", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate spam and allocate resources on the network.\nEthereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Development was funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014. The system went live on 30 July 2015, with 11.9 million coins "premined" for the crowdsale. This accounts for approximately 13 percent of the total circulating supply.\nIn 2016, as a result of the collapse of The DAO project, Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains – the new separate version became Ethereum (ETH), and the original continued as Ethereum Classic (ETC). The value of the Ethereum currency grew over 13,000 percent in 2017.

The idea is to have as many independent servers participate in the Stellar network as possible, so that the network will still run successfully even if some servers fail.\nLike a traditional ledger, the Stellar ledger records a list of all the balances and transactions belonging to every single account on the network. A complete copy of the global Stellar ledger is hosted on each server that runs the Stellar software. Any entity can run a Stellar server.\nThese servers form a decentralized Stellar network, allowing the ledger to be distributed as widely as possible.

The Nexus currency powers the new digital economy by providing fast, affordable, and secure payment channels that are easy to use and eliminate wasteful transaction fees. Nexus provides essential tools to embolden individuals and organizations to manage their finances with complete autonomy. Nexus is the next step in the evolution of financial freedom.\nNexus digital currency allows you to control your finances with complete freedom. Secured by Nexus’s quantum-resistant encryption, access to your funds requires a personal key that only you control, which grants access to your account from anywhere at anytime. There are no restrictions or limitations, no access charges or hidden fees, and no middlemen that can freeze or steal your funds.\nNexus digital currency is a global payment method designed with business needs in mind. There is no downtime, payments process within seconds, and payments received are spendable within 3 minutes. Most importantly there are no service fees or unexpected charges, which means you receive the full proceeds from sale.\nNexus’s blockchain-based technology is essentially an immutable distributed ledger secured across multiple servers. Every transaction ever made is recorded and stored, and can be reviewed transparently. This feature is useful as a receipt system, auditable financial record, or to enable investors or donors to track the use of their contributions.\nThe current financial system allows banks and other institutions to issue loans merely by crediting accounts on a ledger, maintaining only enough cash on hand for short-term needs. Bank deposits are similar in that they are simply a record of how much the bank owes its customers, and are not actually an asset in most cases. Nexus changes this paradigm of debt to one of prosperity by improving the cornerstone of blockchain technology: the immutable, distributed, and transparent ledger. The Nexus protocol ensures positive cash flow by preventing accounts from spending capital they do not have, and loans on the blockchain are only possible through the actual transfer of capital. The creation of new currency is capped at 3% per year, and is awarded in exchange for securing the network, rather than being issued by a central institution. Nexus is the future of value.

959	MinexCoin	MNX	256	3945277	5899215	19000000	1530157163	2139	MinexCoin is a global payment system built on the eponymous low-volatility crypto-asset regulated by an autonomous algorithm with methods proven on traditional financial markets.\nMinexCoin asset is a low-volatility cryptocurrency with predictable and dirigible price development. It may be employed both as a means of settlement and a means of saving. Long-term value of the coin is based on its annual growth of 33.6%. In order to reduce its volatility such supply/demand regulation tools as market interventions and coin parking are used. By parking MNX in your MinexBank account, you may earn your interest with no risk of losing your money. Besides predictable increase of MNX price enables you to earn from increase in the exchange rate.\nThe main purpose of MinexBank is to stabilize the exchange rate within the range of no more than 5% of the previous day’s closure price. The five per cent growth owes to the practice of global stock exchanges. Once the values are reached, stock markets halt the trading, thus preventing speculators and misguided investors from dictating their own prices. Once the limit values of the five per cent range are reached, MinexBank has two options: it either changes interest rates for parking payouts, or intervenes to keep the price within the preset range. Coin parking and intervention are the basic financial instruments used by MinexBank.

21	Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Resumes Downtrend	Key Points\n\nBitcoin cash price failed to move above the $775 resistance and declined against the US Dollar.\nThis week’s highlighted key bearish trend line played well with resistance at $720 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\nThe pair is moving lower and it seems like it could revisit the last swing low of $665.\n\nBitcoin cash price is back in a downtrend below $720 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is likely to accelerate declines back towards the $665 and $650 levels.\nBitcoin Cash Price Decline\nYesterday, we saw a failure near the $775 resistance in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The BCH/USD pair started a fresh downside wave and broke the $750 and $720 support levels. There was even a close below the $750 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It seems like the price failed to break the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $905 high to $664 low.\nIt opened the doors for a new bearish wave and the price tumbled below $700. It even surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $665 low to $779 high. More importantly, this week’s highlighted key bearish trend line played well with resistance at $720 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair is currently trading just below the $700 level with a bearish angle. If the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $665 low to $779 high fails to hold declines, there could be more losses towards the last swing low of $665.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price is back in a downtrend below $720, above which there are chances of an upside recovery.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently near the 30 level.\nMajor Support Level – $665\nMajor Resistance Level – $720\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Resumes Downtrend appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/bitcoin-cash-price-analysis-bch-usd-resumes-downtrend/	2018-06-27 04:08:06+00	43
22	Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Slow and Steady Downtrend	Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price is finding resistance at the short-term descending trend line and area of interest.\nIf the downtrend resumes, bitcoin could tumble to the Fibonacci extension levels next.\nTechnical indicators confirm that the downtrend is likely to carry on from here.\n\nBitcoin price barely gained traction from its bounce as the short-term downtrend remains intact.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. In other words, the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse.\nPrice is also sliding back below the 100 SMA to reflect the return in selling pressure and the gap between the moving averages is widening to reflect stronger downside momentum. Another bounce could still hit resistance at the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point just past the trend line.\nRSI is heading south to confirm that sellers have the upper hand so bitcoin price could follow suit. Stochastic is also moving lower but nearing oversold levels to signal exhaustion among bears.\nIf sellers stay strong, bitcoin price could tumble to the 38.2% extension at $5,953.7 or the swing low at the 50% extension or $5,825.5. The 61.8% extension is located near $5,700 while the 78.6% extension is at $5,514.8. The full extension is near the $5,300 level.\nBTC/USD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin appears to have reeled from Jack Ma’s comments on how the cryptocurrency is likely a bubble even as blockchain technology has several applications. This comes in the heels of hacking incidents and stronger regulatory oversight in Japan.\nAlthough the latter could potentially improve confidence and security in the industry, investors can’t help but be wary of potential restrictions in trading or exchange shutdowns. This has likely led them to be quick about booking profits, barely allowing rallies to be sustained past key technical levels.\nApart from that, the rally in the dollar has also dragged bitcoin down after trade tensions appear to be cooling.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Slow and Steady Downtrend appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/bitcoin-btc-price-watch-slow-steady-downtrend/	2018-06-27 03:27:13+00	16

79	‘Ethereum Killer’ TRON’s Mainnet Activated	Tron will finally enjoy its freedom in its independent public blockchain. The so-called ‘Independence Day’ of Tron was successfully activated yesterday, the 25th of June when the mainnet was launched.\nTron has been part of Ethereum’s blockchain since September 2017, and now will transition itself to its very own blockchain. It initiated with a beta version on May 31st where developers took four weeks to move the standard ERC-20 standard tokens to the new network.\nERC-20 tokens are designed for use in the Ethereum platform and have been a breakthrough for many emerging cryptocurrencies. However recently there have been problems of ERC-20 being destroyed unintentionally when used as a payment for a smart contract.\nThere was a 12-hour live stream which allowed Tron’s community and stakeholders to witness one of the most historic moments for Tron.\n\n#TRON Independence Day live stream starts now,  join us to be part of the free, decentralized internet. https://t.co/M5uzhyfjYf\n— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) June 25, 2018\n\nThe founder of Tron, Justin Sun appeared in an official press conference on June 25th, 2018, 10:00 GMT wherein he announced the good news to the crypto world.  Sun announced-\n“TRON has completed token migration from ERC20 to mainnet. The community consensus initiated the TRON network and generated the Genesis block, which signifies TRON’s official independence. TRON is now one of the most competitive major public chains in the world.”\nTron has challenged Ethereum’s claim to be the best in decentralized application development. Tron’s developers have even boasted confidently about Ethereum’s slow pace, with Tron being ‘400 times faster.’\nAt the press release, Sun also stressed the importance of Tron’s independence by stating-\n“TRON’s independence paves the way for a community governance mechanism that is based on democratic election. It will bring the notion of ‘popular sovereignty and natural rights of the token’ to life and provide support for all developers within TRON’s ecosystem. This is how we will realize TRON’s vision of a truly decentralized Internet.”\nA few days ago, Tron was facing a backlash from the Researchers from Digital Asset Research (DAR). The researchers published an article stating that Tron has plagiarized its code from several cryptocurrency projects including Ethereum.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post ‘Ethereum Killer’ TRON’s Mainnet Activated appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/ethereum-killer-trons-mainnet-activated/	2018-06-26 07:15:47+00	6

23	Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH/USD Under Bearish Pressure	Key Highlights\n\nETH price failed to gain traction and broke the $440 support against the US Dollar.\nThere is a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $460 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\nThe pair is currently under pressure and it seems like it could retest the $$420 swing low.\n\nEthereum price is showing signs of further weakness against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ETH/USD is likely to trade further lower as long as it is below $450-460.\nEthereum Price Resistance\nRecently, there was a failure near the $474 level in ETH price against the US Dollar. The ETH/USD pair started a slow and steady downside move and broke the $450 and $440 support levels. More importantly, there was a close below the $460 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. During the recent slide, the price moved in a bearish zone with a close below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $420 low to $474 high.\nAt present, the price is trading near the $430 level with many bearish signs. If there is an increase in selling pressure, the price could revisit the $420 low. Below this, the price could even test the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last wave from the $420 low to $474 high. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $450 level. Above this, there is a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $460 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price is clearly poised to extend declines below $430. To initiate a fresh recovery, buyers need to push the price above $460 and the 100 hourly SMA. Above $460, the next resistance is around the $474-475 zone.\nHourly MACD – The MACD is moving in the bearish zone with negative signs.\nHourly RSI – The RSI is currently placed well below the 40 level.\nMajor Support Level – $420\nMajor Resistance Level – $460\nThe post Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH/USD Under Bearish Pressure appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-usd-bearish-pressure/	2018-06-27 05:00:49+00	10

86	Bitcoin Looks Like its Finally Recovering	Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ToshiTimes.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe last one week has got Bitcoin traders sitting bored to getting their hearts to their mouths.\nAs you can see from the graph below, you can’t blame Bitcoin trader’s emotional sides coming out.\n\nOn June 17th Bitcoin was in the comfortable zone of $6500 and was maintaining this till the 19th of June. After the 19th of June, you see a sudden spike in the market touching prices higher than $6700.\nThe $6700 mark was continuously maintained till June 22nd when all hell broke out for Bitcoin.\nYou can’t blame the market after hacks such as the Bithumb hack. Bithumb has been hacked for the third time in 12 months. The hack led to a $30 million loss, and traders losing confidence in Bitcoin.\nHence points of $6000 were reached on the 23rd of June, with Hodler’s hoping it would not decrease more. However, it slid to the $5800 mark by the end of 24th June.\nCurrently, at the time of writing, 11:02 UTC BTC has recovered by 5% in the last 24 hours by getting back above the $6000 price line. It is trading at the time of writing at $6147.\nWhat next?\nIt all depends on if BTC can survive in the trends of above $6100 as the resistance barrier of $6400 needs to be pursued for if a Bull market is to be spotted. However, if it fails to be above $6100, it will have a problem to recover back\nThe good news for American citizens is Square acquiring Bitlicense which will lead to an easier method of buying and selling of Bitcoins. Thus you can expect more Americans to join in the Bitcoin buy rally in the next couple of days.\nThe increasing use of batching and SegWit adoption has in a whole led to a fall in transaction fees thus leading to higher demand.\nMost of the indicators are pointing to a mature market with signs of a bull market.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Bitcoin Looks Like its Finally Recovering appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/bitcoin-looks-like-its-finally-recovering/	2018-06-25 12:48:50+00	2
24	Here We Go Again, Another $12 Billion Dumped From Crypto Markets	FOMO Moments\nRed dominates crypto land, only Qtum survives today. EOS, Tron, OmiseGO and Zcash get hammered.\nCrypto traders and investors are probably dreading getting up each morning now to see markets plummet once again with seemingly no end in sight. Over the past 24 hours markets have dumped another $12 billion from $255 to $243 billion, equating to a 4.7% fall. Trade volume also took a sharp drop from $18 billion to $11 billion.\n\nBitcoin’s short recovery spell got kicked in the digital cojones when markets lost $8 billion in just over two hours. Bitcoin has fallen 3% on the day and is struggling to stay above $6k, currently trading at $6,075. That prediction of a decline to around $5k seems to be holding strong, BTC is currently in a downward channel and approaching more critical support levels.\nAs usual Ethereum has fared even worse shedding 5.8% to $432, and barreling towards that critical $400 level. The lowest point for ETH this year was in early April when it fell to just below $370 before over doubling in price over the next month. Predictably all altcoins are getting punished even harder, many crashing by double digits once again.\nAgain it is EOS that is taking the biggest hit at the time of writing, down over 8% to $7.50. There are now major concerns about the EOS network and its lack of decentralization, the Reddit stream for the project is largely FUD fueled and negative. From its all-time high of $21.50, almost two months ago, EOS has hemorrhaged 65% to its current trading level.\nBitcoin Cash and Litecoin are both getting bashed by around 7.5%, with BCH falling to $690 and LTC dropping to $76. Litecoin has not been this low since mid-November, before it started to spike. Charlie Lee and the LTC camp have been conspicuously quiet throughout this crypto rout.\nRipple’s XRP could not make it back over $0.50 and has lost 5.2% on the day falling to $0.45, matching its lowest dip of the year. Stellar and Cardano are both down around 6% and Iota in tenth spot has lost 7% to trade at $0.94, a new 2018 low. Other altcoins getting battered during the morning’s Asian trading session include Tron down 8%, Ethereum Classic dropping 7.7%, Ontology losing 7.5%, OmiseGO 8.5% down, and similar losses for Zcash, Icon, Zilliqa, and Bytecoin.\nThe only altcoin in the green in the top 30 at the time of writing is Qtum which is up 7.3% on the day to just under $9.\nFOMO Moments is a section that takes a daily look at the top 25 altcoins during the Asian trading session and analyses the best performing one, looking for trends and possible fundamentals.\nThe post Here We Go Again, Another $12 Billion Dumped From Crypto Markets appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/here-we-go-again-another-12-billion-dumped-from-crypto-markets/	2018-06-27 05:10:53+00	17

78	Visa Cryptocurrency Would Only be Worth $3 Billion?	The founder and CEO of BitGo, Ben Davenport used some basic calculations to arrive at the conclusion that the value of payment utility in crypto may be worth just three billion dollars, after responding to comments made by CEO of Civic, Vinny Lingham on twitter.\n\nThe reason I believe that crypto has to have real utility &amp; usage to support the price, is because when all the speculation ends, that ensures there is a baseline of demand – be it Bitcoin or any other crypto. I hope my views are understood to be pragmatic, and not negative.\n— Vinny Lingham (@VinnyLingham) June 24, 2018\n\nLingham’s post which attracted Davenport’s comments, argued that utility value of a cryptocurrency is critical as it ensures a baseline level of demand, once speculative demand disappears.\nDavenport however, said that this value created purely by utility was actually so small as to be negligible in the portion of the overall value of a currency. Over a number of consecutive tweets, Davenport laid out his mathematical reasoning.\nIn a hypothetical scenario, Davenport theorized about what would happen if payments giant Visa launched its own cryptocurrency, whose utility was that it could settle transactions and convert them into local currencies within 1 hour. Visa currently handles over $9 trillion in transactions every year and has a market cap of $294 billion.\nDavenport’s reasoning followed that at the end of dividing this all down (through the quick maths of 9 trillion / 365 days / 24 hours *3 to account for holidays and increased shopping periods) the base line value created by utility, as Lingham had put it, was left at a meagre $3 billion.\nThrough this reasoning, Davenport added:\n“A HODLer choosing to hold a coin for even a month is 720 times as effective at generating base demand as the payments use case in your example…”\nThis is obviously very quick maths designed to illustrate a point. Davenport even admits that people would certainly hold on to a Visa-issued crypto for longer durations, but his argument nevertheless raises poignant questions. Most proponents of the technology advocate that developing use cases is the way to secure the future of crypto, however with such possibly limited base-level value created by the utility provided by one of the largest payments solutions providers on the planet, we may be left scratching our heads.\nHowever, we should bear in mind a couple of points: firstly, utility and speculative demand can never be truly separated and in fact, utility drives speculative demand to a significant degree. This is called hype, and it can be seen with price spikes around announcements of payments solutions like Litepay and Bitpay. \nFurthermore, this theory fails to show how utility will still increase crypto value: HODLers will always be present in a market for a deflationary asset – aka, one with a limited supply, like bitcoin or indeed gold – the idea is buying it now, will mean selling it for more later. Utility will increase demand for that deflationary asset by both the firms utilising it, and HODLers, who will pile in.

25	Ripple Price Analysis: XRP/USD Resumes Downtrend	Key Highlights\n\nRipple price failed to hold gains above the $0.4700 support and declined against the US dollar.\nThere is a new key bearish trend line formed with resistance near $0.4600 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).\nThe pair may continue to decline and it could retest the last swing low of $0.4400.\n\nRipple price is back in a downtrend against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. XRP/USD is under pressure below $0.4700 for more losses towards the $0.4400 low.\nRipple Price Trend\nThere was a major struggle to hold gains above the $0.4700 level in Ripple price against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair failed to gain traction and declined below the $0.4600 support. The decline was such that the price traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $0.4400 low to $0.4940 high. It opened the doors for more losses below $0.4600 and the price moved in a bearish zone.\nIt spiked below the $0.4500 level and formed a low at $0.4482 recently. At the moment, the price is trading near the $0.4500 level. An initial resistance is around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last recent decline from the $0.4933 high to $0.4482 low. There is also a new key bearish trend line formed with resistance near $0.4600 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. Above the trend line resistance, the $0.4700 is a crucial resistance. It now coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the last recent decline from the $0.4933 high to $0.4482 low.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price is likely to struggle to move above $0.4600 and $0.4700. On the downside, the $0.4400 zone is a major support, below which, the price could test $0.4200.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is well below the 40 level.\nMajor Support Level – $0.4400\nMajor Resistance Level – $0.4700\nThe post Ripple Price Analysis: XRP/USD Resumes Downtrend appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/ripple-price-analysis-xrp-usd-resumes-downtrend/	2018-06-27 07:00:40+00	13

80	Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads	Facebook’s ban on cryptocurrency advertisements at the end of January 2018 took the crypto world a few steps back. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts will be smiling widely today as Facebook has realized the importance of the technology and reversed the ban after six months.\nThe blog post on Facebook’s official Business website written by Rob Leathern, Facebook’s Product manager, read- \n“In the last few months, we’ve looked at the best way to refine this policy — to allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe. So starting June 26, we’ll be updating our policy to allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”\nIt is clear that advertisements from pre-approved cryptocurrency businesses will be allowed which will enhance the trust between investors and these companies.\nHowever, due to history Initial Coin Offerings (ICO’s) and Binary Options will still be prohibited from Facebook advertising. \nIn the new guidelines, an application needs to be filled by the business with appropriate details such as licenses, public stock exchange information and public background documents if possible.\nThe blog post also highlighted the future of cryptocurrency advertisements on the popular social media website-\n“Given these restrictions, not everyone who wants to advertise will be able to do so. But we’ll listen to feedback, look at how well this policy works and continue to study this technology so that, if necessary, we can revise it over time.”\nThe reason for Facebook’s reversal is still not clear. There are signs of Facebook implementing Blockchain technology with news in April about David Marcus, former Facebook messenger executive leading a Blockchain team for Facebook.\nAnother reason may be the lost opportunities and revenue from advertisements generated from the highly sought after blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/facebook-reverses-ban-on-cryptocurrency-ads/	2018-06-27 07:54:55+00	0
26	Cardano Price Analysis: ADA/USD Remains in Downtrend	Key Highlights\n\nADA price struggled to move above the $0.1400 resistance level and declined against the US Dollar (tethered).\nThere are two key bearish trend lines formed with resistance at $0.1300 and $0.1350 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data feed via Bittrex).\nThe pair is likely to extend the current slide below the $0.1250 support level in the near term.\n\nCardano price struggled to hold gains against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ADA/USD is now in a bearish trend with supports at $0.1200 and $0.1100.\nCardano Price Analysis\nThere was no upside break above $0.1500 in ADA price against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair even failed to settle above the $0.1400 resistance level. As a result, there was a downside reaction and the price declined below the $0.1300 support area. It is now trading well below the $0.1400 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nDuring the recent slide, the price broke the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $0.1197 low to $0.1388 high. It has opened the doors for more losses and the price is now at a risk of further slides below $0.1250. The next supports on the downside are seen near $0.1200. Below this, the price may perhaps test the $0.1100 level. On the upside, there are many resistances below the $0.1400 level. More importantly, there are two key bearish trend lines formed with resistance at $0.1300 and $0.1350 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair.\n\nThe chart indicates that the price is likely to face a lot of sellers on the upside between $0.1300 and $0.1400. Only a successful close above $0.1400 might stop the current slide. If not, the price will most likely extend declines towards the $0.1100 level.\nHourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is placed heavily in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI – The RSI for ADA/USD is now well below the 50 level with bearish signs.\nMajor Support Level – $0.1200\nMajor Resistance Level – $0.1350\nThe post Cardano Price Analysis: ADA/USD Remains in Downtrend appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/cardano-price-analysis-ada-usd-remains-downtrend/	2018-06-27 08:00:59+00	9

83	Stellar Acquires San Francisco-Based ”Chain” Startup	The past week saw significant speculation regarding a potential acquisition by Stellar, the company behind Stellar Lumens (XLM), of the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency firm Chain. We can now report that a recent Crunchbase update confirms that Chain has indeed been purchased by Stellar.\nDetails of the actual acquisition are sparse, however, it is to have officially taken place on the 24th of June. Furthermore, reports leading up to the purchase indicated that the payment was to be made in Lumens, Stellar’s cryptocurrency.\nAlthough the specifics of the deal are not known, it was widely reported that Stellar would acquire Chain for $500 million worth of Lumens (XLM). This comes as Stellar is currently rated as the seventh most valuable cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of more than $4.3 billion.\nChain, on the other hand, has previously raised more than $43 million in funding to develop blockchain technologies for the financial sector, and to package blockchain technology in accessible ways for financial institutions and banks. \nChain also specializes in building cryptographic ledgers, and Nasdaq has previously announced that they will use Chain’s technology to construct a distributed ledger-powered system together with the financial services behemoth Citigroup.\nAs of yet, it is still unclear how Stellar plans to incorporate Chain into its existing offerings and ecosystem. Some have suggested that this acquisition might merely constitute a part of the ongoing battle for talented cryptocurrency developers between cryptocurrency companies, indicating that Stellar wanted to poach Chain’s talent before anyone else could.\nIt is also unknown whether Chain will continue with its existing line of products, such as the platform ”Sequence” – a ”ledger-as-a-service that enables organizations to securely track and transfer balances in a token format”. Similarly, it is not known whether Chain’s CEO Adam Ludwin will remain at Stellar or not.\nNonetheless, it would seem that Chain and Stellar could certainly benefit from synergies, as Stellar continues its mission to integrate blockchain technology into pre-existing financial systems.\nMoreover, this comes merely a week after Stellar Lumens received approval for trading from New York’s financial regulators to trade on ItBit, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange. \nIn addition to this, IBM also recently indicated that they were exploring a new currency based on the Stellar ecosystem, which would be used to send payments between nations in the South Pacific region.\nStellar’s blockchain technology is also being used in order to construct the cryptocurrency for the messaging startup Kik. It would, therefore, seem as if there are certainly ample opportunities for Chains’ products to be used by Stellar, as it continues to work with financial systems and solutions.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Stellar Acquires San Francisco-Based ”Chain” Startup appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/stellar-acquires-san-francisco-based-chain-startup/	2018-06-26 13:52:34+00	0
27	Bitcoin Price Watch: Can BTC/USD Hold $6,000?	Key Points\n\nBitcoin price struggled to gain traction and moved below the $6,200 support against the US Dollar.\nYesterday’s highlighted important bearish trend line with resistance at $6,200 is acting as a barrier on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\nThe pair remains at a risk of a downside break below $6,000 if it fails to move above $6,200.\n\nBitcoin price is under pressure below $6,200 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must stay above the $6,000 support to avoid further losses in the near term.\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nYesterday, we saw a major rejection near the $6,300 resistance in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair slowly and steadily declined and moved below the $6,200 support area. There was a failure noted around the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $6,750 swing high to $5,650 low. At the moment, the price is trading in a bearish zone below the $6,200 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nDuring the recent slide, there was a break below the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $5,658 low to $6,339 high. However, bitcoin buyers were able to hold declines below the $6,050 and $6,000 levels. The mentioned $6,000 support is very important for the current decline. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $5,658 low to $6,339 high. Therefore, a downside break below $6,000 could be significant for more losses. On the upside, yesterday’s highlighted important bearish trend line with resistance at $6,200 is intact on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price must break the trend line, 100 SMA, and the $6,200 resistance to avoid a downside break below $6,000. The next support is around the $5,850 level.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is about to move back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving higher towards the 40 level.\nMajor Support Level – $6,000\nMajor Resistance Level – $6,200\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Can BTC/USD Hold $6,000? appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/bitcoin-price-watch-can-btc-usd-hold-6000/	2018-06-27 08:38:53+00	14

82	Hong Kong-Based Financial Services Firm To Acquire 49% of BTCC Mining Pool	The cryptocurrency exchange BTCC’s mining pool business, BTCC Pool Limited, has reportedly agreed to sell 49% of its equity. If finalized, this deal would see the 49% acquired by the Hong Kong-based Value Convergence Holdings Limited financial services firm.\nValue Convergence recently released a statement which clearly outlines how the acquisition would be undertaken. Value Convergence would purchase 4,900 shares in BTCC Pool, which translates to a 49% stake, and the deal would reportedly raise approximately $18.7 million.\nMoreover, Value Convergence has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) which, although not legally binding, clearly communicates the intent of Value Convergence to go through with the purchase of BTCC Pool, through its subsidiary Initial Honor Limited.\nThe MoU, which is not final and could admittedly be subject to revisions, includes a notable clause which states that the audited net profit of BTCC Pool should see a guaranteed minimum of $3.82 million after taxation for the fiscal year which ends in June of 2019.\nValue Convergence mainly operates a securities brokerage within the greater China area, as well as some other business through its many subsidiaries. \nThe acquisition of BTCC Pool would mark the firm’s first entry into the cryptocurrency industry, and is said to signal a more comprehensive shift intended to grow Value Convergence’s presence in the fintech sector – even though the Bitcoin mining pool business would technically be purchased by Value Convergence’s subsidiary Initial Honor Limited.\nNotably, this somewhat follows in the footsteps of BTCC, which was also acquired by a Hong Kong-based company earlier this year. BTCC, formerly known as BTC China, was forced to exit the Chinese market following new regulations in relation to ICOs and the cryptocurrency sector in general. \nAt the moment, BTCC’s activity mainly involves the aforementioned mining pool, as well as a cryptocurrency wallet dubbed ”Mobi”, as well as a USD/BTC exchange. Although this acquisition, if realized, would give significant control over the BTCC mining pool to Value Convergence, BTCC would still hold a stake of its own in the pool.\nRecent data from the website blockchain.info has also revealed that the BTCC Pool currently accounts for around 1.1% of Bitcoin’s hashing power. Whilst this is a sizable amount, it is dwarfed by the large mining pools operated by Chinese cryptocurrency mining behemoth Bitmain.\nMore specifically, it was recently reported that Bitmain had claimed a whopping 42% of the total blocks on the Bitcoin network last week. Whilst BTCC Pool does not rival this, a 1.1% of the total hashrate of Bitcoin is still nothing to scoff at. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether both parties in the BTCC Pool acquisition will honor the non-binding MoU.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Hong Kong-Based Financial Services Firm To Acquire 49% of BTCC Mining Pool appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/hong-kong-based-financial-services-firm-to-acquire-49-of-btcc-mining-pool/	2018-06-25 17:41:00+00	2
28	Crypto Analyst Believes Bitcoin Could be Nearing Price Bottom	Many in the cryptocurrency community thought that Bitcoin bottomed at $6,000, as it held over that price level for weeks on end. However, Bitcoin dropped under $5,800 on the weekend, leading some to believe that Bitcoin’s price could move even lower. Brian Kelly, leading cryptocurrency trader and analyst on CNBC, drew attention to four reasons why he believes the most popular cryptocurrency has found a price bottom. \nBullish Rebound Off $5779, The Cost To Mine One Bitcoin\nKelly opened up his segment by acknowledging that Bitcoin had reached a yearly low of approximately $5,779. Although new lows would traditionally be seen as a negative sign, the CNBC trader noted that the quick rebound off $5,779 is indicative of Bitcoin finding a price bottom. Kelly elaborated on this point, saying:\n“Over the weekend we saw Bitcoin hit new lows, I think we saw Bitcoin hit $5779. Then within about 10 or 15 minutes you have a huge ramp up, 100 to 200 points. This is typically the action that Bitcoin has shown at bottoms.”\nBrian Kelly also mentioned that the average mining cost of one BTC sits around $5,900, indicating a potential for strong support over that level. Tom Lee, co-founder of analysis firm Fundstrat, also believes that the mining costs are a vital level for the most prominent cryptocurrency to hold.\nIn an appearance on CNBC, Lee noted that prices for Bitcoin have historically held above mining costs, especially in the cryptocurrency bear market of 2014.\nAsian Investment Interest Has Risen, But Is It Due To Currency Devaluation? \nKelly briefly mentioned Asian demand, prompting Melissa Lee, reporter and news anchor at CNBC, to question the cryptocurrency trader about what he specifically meant. Kelly went on to say that an OTC desk saw interest for Tether, “used in global arbitrage,” increase, especially through the Asian exchanges. \nThe addition of 250 Million USDT was also an indicator which he used, expressing that the issuance of Tether “indicates there’s demand coming, and most of that demand is Asian demand as they most of the Asian exchanges use quite a bit of the Tether product (USDT).”\nWith Melessia Lee also pointing out that the ‘granting’ of Tether shows that fiat investment into the industry is on the rise. \nLast but not least, Kelly mentioned that there is a direct correlation between “currency crisis” and the rise in the price of crypto assets, specifically Bitcoin. The CNBC trader also noted that crpytocurrencies, like Bitcoin “work very well” for being “an alternative currency,” holding its value through a decentralized system in comparison with centralized government-issued currencies. \nKelly specifically mentioning the case with China’s currency issues. He stated:\n“If we remember what’s the final option for China here? It’s probably a devaluation of the currency… And if you’re a wealthy Chinese person and you are thinking that’s going to come (currency devaluation), where would you want to put your money? Certainly not in RMB (China’s currency). You may want to put it in some Bitcoin.”\nIt is still unclear whether Kelly’s price bottom prediction is accurate. But the accuracy of his analysis will become apparent over the following weeks as volatility in this market continues.\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Crypto Analyst Believes Bitcoin Could be Nearing Price Bottom appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/brian-kelly-believes-bitcoin-could-be-nearing-a-price-bottom/	2018-06-27 06:00:53+00	14

77	Alibaba Payment Affiliate Successfully Trials Blockchain Remittance Service	Ant Finance, a payment branch of the e-commerce and retail giant Alibaba, has launched a blockchain-based money remittance service. Ant Finance is the parent company of the world’s largest online payments platform Alipay, which could hugely benefit from further integration of distributed ledger technology to its operations.\nThe new service trials were announced at a press conference held in Hong Kong and it seems the initial plan is to offer it for customers sending money between Hong Kong and Philippines. The first transfer was successfully completed between the AliPayHK app in Hong Kong and Filipino payment app GCash. The companies claim the new service will settle transactions within seconds, while its users will not have to deal with intermediaries, who often charge lofty taxes.\nPhilippines was the third biggest remittance market globally in 2017, with inflows of over $33 billion, while Hong Kong is among the top money transfer destinations for Filipinos abroad. Thus, the new service targets a market with undoubted potential, providing round-the-clock money transfer between the two countries with much lower transaction fees, which will even be obsolete during the three month trial period.\nThe outspoken CEO of Alibaba Jack Ma hinted the new app will soon expand to other countries, saying that, “Using blockchain to achieve cross-border remittances is one of my most concerned projects in the past six months. Starting from Hong Kong, AlipayHK will be brought to the rest of the world in the future“.\nHe also went on to reaffirm his belief in the future of blockchain technology, claiming that, “Blockchain should not be a tech to get rich overnight…There are still 1.7 billion people in the world who have no bank accounts, but most of them have mobile phones. The impact of blockchain on the future of humans may be far beyond our imagination.“\nThe announcement comes amid the recent news that Ant Finance has secured a staggering $14 billion of funding, most of which will be spent on distributed ledger technology development.\nDespite being a staunch proponent of blockchain, Ma criticizes cryptocurrencies and particularly BTC on a constant basis, this time saying that bitcoin could be a bubble, while blockchain is most definitely not.\nHe also took aim at current financial giants, claiming they are overcharging for international payments. Banks and other remittance services currently operating in Hong Kong charge a transaction fee but users might also have to pay additional commission and currency conversion fees.\nMa finished by saying that, “Traditional financial institutions serve 20 percent of people and make 80 percent of profits. New financial institutions should service 80 percent of people, and make 20 percent of profit.“\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Alibaba Payment Affiliate Successfully Trials Blockchain Remittance Service appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/alibaba-payment-affiliate-successfully-trials-blockchain-remittance-service/	2018-06-25 17:10:32+00	5
29	Can Cryptocurrency be Weaponized to Derail US Electoral Process	A US Senate committee was convened yesterday to hear out the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being used to influence future elections as primaries were being held in several states.\nBitcoin is a Weapon\nAs Bloomberg reported, the senators were gathered to hear about how cryptocurrency is a tool, almost tailor-made, that bad actors can use to buy influence in the same way a lobbyist would due to its decentralized and anonymous design. Cyber-security consultant Scott Duewke told the Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing that “Foreign parties, state actors and, potentially, others interested in affecting U.S. political processes need anonymity,”\nThere was a general consensus among senators and witnesses alike that virtual currencies were not as accessible during the 2016 election, which is widely thought to have been at least somewhat tampered with by agents using social media on Russia’s behalf. But that today:\n“(cryptocurrency) should be considered a potentially formidable weapon in the arsenal of those wishing to confuse voters or disrupt the vote,”\nSenators combined the fears of attackers using cryptocurrencies and shell companies in order to gain influence and affect the outcome of American elections. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island Democrat told the committee that “Vladimir Putin and his oligarchs can use the exact same tactics that American special interests use to spend anonymous money in our elections and secure influence,”\nThe Senate committee took place as many states held primary and run-off elections and, as information about Russia’s influence in the 2016 presidential election continues on voters are increasingly concerned about the sanctity of the electoral process. Which they should be. There is no doubt for most that Russia used Facebook and other social media sites to try and influence the 2016 election.\nInfluence was bought with Paypal\nAccording to research done by a professor of journalism at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Mie Kim, and published in Wired, Facebook ran some 5 million sponsored adds during the build-up to the 2016 election that focused on political content. Of those 5 million ads Kim studied a pool of 50,000 and found that one of six had probable links to the Russian propaganda group, Internet Research Agency.\nThe operatives that ran those adds didn’t need a “cloaked” method of transferring money, they used PayPal, and they did so with fake identifications just as they would have to open accounts with cryptocurrencies if they had.\nThere was no indication in Bloomberg’s article about what prompted this Senate committee to gather and hear experts like Mr. Dueweke say things like “Russia has been able to leverage these virtual currencies,”. But, it would have been a good idea to invite someone from the crypto space or even one of the many US regulatory bodies that have been involved in developing KYC (know your customer), anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist practices that are quickly becoming standard for exchanges around the world. Also to explain that cryptocurrency was widely known and used in 2016 by people all over the world.\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Can Cryptocurrency be Weaponized to Derail US Electoral Process appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/us-senate-committee-told-that-cryptocurrency-can-be-used-to-derail-electoral-process/	2018-06-27 09:00:21+00	7

81	Tether Releases $250 Million of USDT Tokens, Investors Await Crypto Price Jump	Tether (USDT), a stablecoin that is reportedly backed to US Dollar on a 1:1 ratio, has just printed 250 million of USDT tokens. This would indicate that $250 million has been deposited into Tether’s bank accounts. Despite its widespread use and significant market cap, USDT is a subject of constant controversy as the crypto world is doubtful about the solvency of the project.\nAmong the most recent controversies are the allegations that USDT was behind the bitcoin price manipulation in 2017, when BTC almost eclipsed the $20,000 mark. A study by the researchers at the University of Texas claimed that BTC price spike was impacted by a ”conscious strategy to provide price support” using Tether tokens. \nHowever, the controversies do not stop here and have in fact started as early as last October, when it was revealed that USDT shared very similar ownership with the crypto exchange Bitfinex. The negative sentiment surrounding the stablecoin further deepened in January when the company fired Friedman LLP, an independent law firm that was hired to perform an official audit on Tether’s holdings.\nNonetheless, Tether has finally provided some clarity on its USD assets, as a US-based law firm Freeh Sporkin and Sullivan LLP checked the bank accounts of the company. The auditors came to a conclusion that Tether’s USD reserves are equal to USDT tokens in circulation and amount to $2.55 billion, clearing at least some of the controversy. \nTether’s CEO JL van der Velde said at the time that, “Despite speculation, we have consistently stated that Tether is backed by USD reserves at or exceeding the Tethers in circulation at a given moment, and we’re glad to have independent verification of this to answer some of the questions posed by the public.“\nBeing a stablecoin means token provides value that does not change even when the market undergoes periods of volatility, as has been the case with crypto markets for most of their existence. Even though, there are minimal fluctuations the price of USDT has not changed by more than $0.05.\nThe ingestion of new Tether tokens usually results in increasing prices of bitcoin and subsequently most other digital currencies. The last such influx of USDT tokens happened on May 18th, and BTC climbed from $8100 to $8500 in the next couple of days. However, the spike did not last long and BTC price has dipped by almost 25% since then.\nImmediately after the issuance of new USDT, BTC price jumped by over $150 but has slightly decreased since then to trade around $6210 at press time. The release of additional Tether tokens raised the market cap for the stablecoin to over $2.7 billion. This, coupled with the slight decrease in the price of TRON, despite it launching the mainnet today, let Tether finally enter the top 10 of biggest cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap data.\nAccording to official statements on the Tether website, the firm is holding over $3 billion in its reserve bank accounts, indicating that a further influx of around $300 million worth of USDT tokens could be on the cards soon.\nHowever, not everyone is convinced new USDT tokens will help the crypto market rebound after a prolonged slump, as Litecoin founder Charlie Lee commented on the event:\n\nGenerally, this has been a precursor of price going up. Tether gets printed when people deposit USD and get USDT back. This USDT will then be used to buy crypto. This is similar to someone depositing $250MM to exchanges. Of course, that doesn't mean they will buy right away.

30	Monero (XMR) Price Watch: Channel Still Intact!	Monero Price Key Highlights\n\nMonero price is still in trading inside its descending channel despite the spike higher.\nThis means that the downtrend is still likely to resume from here, as reflected by technical indicators also.\nHowever, the mid-channel area of interest is keeping losses in check and Monero price is testing resistance once more.\n\nMonero price could resume its downtrend as the channel resistance is holding but there could be a chance for a break higher.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This basically means that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. Also, the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point lines up with the top of the channel to add to its strength as resistance.\nRSI is already on the move down to indicate that sellers have the upper hand. Stochastic has also made its way down from overbought levels to signal a return in selling pressure. This might be enough to take Monero to the channel support at $80 or at least the mid-channel area of interest at $100.\nPrice recently spiked higher but was unable to sustain the gains. Then again, the mid-channel area of interest is holding so far, signaling that buyers are still trying to put up a fight.\nXMR/USD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nCryptocurrencies are still on the back foot, owing to recent security hacks and increased oversight in Japan. Last week, authorities in the country gave business improvement requirements to bitcoin exchanges to step up their efforts to crack down on money laundering and terrorist financing activity.\nMeanwhile, the dollar is drawing support from cooling trade tensions as the Trump administration is willing to let the CFIUS evaluate which foreign investments should be restricted in terms of acquiring or investing in US tech companies.\nThe post Monero (XMR) Price Watch: Channel Still Intact! appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/monero-xmr-price-watch-channel-still-intact/	2018-06-27 03:37:54+00	10

85	Crypto Exchange Leaks Customer Private Information Putting $620K at Risk	Usually, hackers try to find information about cryptocurrency exchanges and its users, but this time a cryptocurrency exchange has made their lives a whole lot easier. Bitkoex, a South Korean exchange has leaked information which has put into risk the users of the exchange.\nThe leaked information puts into risk 19 of Bitkoex’s users which as a result will put a tempting $620,000 on the line for hackers to target. \nHow did this negligence from Bitkoex take place? According to a report, an employee of Bitkoex posted information on how much Karma (KRM) cryptocurrency 19 users on the platform were holding. It also included email addresses, wallet addresses and the private keys to the KRM tokens. Thus anyone with the information will be able to access the assets. \nBitkoex is a reasonably new exchange in South Korea, which was launched in May 2018.\nSince the announcement, Bitkoex played it’s cards right by moving the exposed assets to a cold wallet which will not be accessible through the internet and so the company reported in losing none of the tokens.\nWith such details having to be kept safe and secure, you would think this was the first time it happened. However Bithumb, one of the largest South Korean exchanges already faced the same issue with 30,000 users details being publicized last year.\nA report has confirmed that most of the 21 South Korean exchanges have security vulnerabilities. It is not surprising news given the number of hacks already taken place in the South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges.\nJust last week Bithumb was hacked and faced a loss of $30 million. Bithumb is so popular that Bitcoin was reported to have faced a slump falling by nearly $200 due to the negativity of the hack. \nTwo weeks ago, another South Korean exchange called Coinrail was hacked. The Coinrail team tried to keep the situation calm by calling it a cyber intrusion. However, the public feared the worst already.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Crypto Exchange Leaks Customer Private Information Putting $620K at Risk appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/crypto-exchange-leaks-customer-private-information-putting-620k-at-risk/	2018-06-26 10:10:08+00	1

84	A New Crypto Exchange Model is Sparking Controversy and Shaking up the Industry	Two relative newcomers have hit the top cryptocurrency exchange rankings in terms of daily volume, overtaking such industry stalwarts as OKEx, Binance and Bitfinex. Overtaking is putting it mildly, as the Singapore-based CoinBene clocked over $2.1 billion, more than doubling the 24 hour volume of OKEx, which barely eclipsed the $1 billion mark. Another new player, the Hong Kong-based Bit-Z comfortably sits in the second spot, with 24 hour trading volume well over $1.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\nThe reason behind such a surprise emergence is pretty simple – a new business model that is different from all other traditional crypto exchanges. The so-called “trans-fee mining” sees exchanges adopting what you could call a more user-friendly approach and moving beyond traditional fee-taking model. In the trans-fee model crypto exchanges issue their own tokens as a way to encourage customers to trade on the platform.\nIn the case of Bit-Z, the exchange plans to release 300 million of its own BZ tokens. The clients, trading on Bit-Z will still have to pay transaction fees in bitcoin or ethereum, however the fee will be fully reimbursed to a customer in BZ tokens once the transaction is complete.\nThe companies have only launched their services in the last few days but the public interest proved to be overwhelming, as the trading volumes in the new exchanges soared beyond expectation. Nonetheless, the new model has already faced criticism, particularly from established players within the crypto exchange market.\nZhao Changpeng, CEO of Binance, likened the trans-fee model to an ICO, posting on Weibo that, “You pay transaction fees to the platform with BTC and ETH. Then the platform pays ‘100%’ back to you with its token. Isn’t it just buying platform token with BTC and ETH? How is this different from an ICO?”\nHe also went on to predict possible manipulation that the new model supposedly enables, claiming that, “If an exchange doesn’t get revenue from transaction fees and solely profits from the price of its token. How would it survive without manipulating the token price? Are you sure you want to play against a price manipulator? The same price manipulator who controls the trading platform?“\nMr. Changpeng was referring to FCoin, a Chinese exchange, using a trans-fee model. While prominent sources, such as CoinMarketCap are not tracking its data yet, Chinese media outlets suggest its 24-hour trading volume could be a staggering $5.6 billion. The company operates its own FT Token that is capped at 10 billion. 49 percent of the supply is held for the exchange and its investors, while the remaining 51 percent is distributed to the public.\nAnother controversy associated with the budding model is that it could encourage users to create fake transactions just to obtain the exchange tokens. Questions about sustaining the model in long-term have also been raised. Nonetheless, there is a new player making waves in the market and the old guard is definitely keeping their eyes open.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post A New Crypto Exchange Model is Sparking Controversy and Shaking up the Industry appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/a-new-crypto-exchange-model-is-sparking-controversy-and-shaking-up-the-industry/	2018-06-26 16:40:23+00	14

108	Apple’s Wozniak Calling the Blockchain Kettle Black	The co-founder of Apple and Bitcoin supporter went on record yesterday saying that he thinks that blockchain today shows all the signs of a bubble.\nWozniak Calls Blockchain a Hyped Bubble\nSteve Wozniak, who co-founded Apple with Steve jobs in 1976 and is widely considered the man behind the engineering of their first computer, was on stage Tuesday at the NEX technology conference in New York talking about the future of blockchain technology. As he sees it the hype around blockchain today is much like the early days of the dotcom era. He told the audience: “It was a bubble, and I feel that way about blockchain,”\nAs a large portion of the early internet companies promising great things so will those using blockchain today was the overall message Wozniak was putting out. Though he believes in the potential of the technology calling it “decentralized and totally trustworthy”, he also believes that it is going to take time to see companies fulfill their promises. “If you look now you say all that internet stuff happened, we got it, it just took a while,” Wozniak said at the NEX conference before adding:\n “It doesn’t change in a day, a lot of the blockchain ideas that are really good by coming out early they can burn themselves out by not being prepared to be stable in the long run.”\nWas Wozniak being ironic or just using selective memory while talking about hype and the benefits of a decentralized technology?  As the co-founder of a company that took product hyping to a new level, while maintaining proprietary software and hardware in order to keep consumers locked into a circle of upgrade and replace, it seems he would know a lot about one and not much of the other. The grandiose centralization of Apple’s products has made it billions of dollars, while consumers still have minimal control over “their” devices aside from what the mothership allows.\nRemember the G4 Cube\nApple is responsible for many breakthrough products in its history, starting in 1977 with the Apple II, but it has also created some spectacular washouts because their devices don’t play well with others. From the Newton to Firewire, Apple’s obsession with keeping their tech secretive is the epitome of centralization and if that is the case, doomed to be left behind by decentralized companies in Wozniak’s own estimation.\nWozniak illustrated this perfectly when he said Ethereum will outlive the current hype bubble because of the platform’s utility. A utility that comes from allowing companies like J.P. Morgan to develop smart contracts as well as independent developers to create apps.\nThough Wozniak is known as a Bitcoin Bull and still calls it “just amazing,” he sold all but one coin during the height of the tokens value.  As he was quoted by CNBC “All of the sudden it was way down, then way up in the sky, I got scared, and sold everything but one bitcoin.” Showing he knows how to bail out when a “bubble” is bursting.\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Apple’s Wozniak Calling the Blockchain Kettle Black appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/apples-wozniak-calling-blockchain-kettle-black/	2018-06-27 10:00:16+00	33
110	CryptoAds’ Public Crowdsale Kicks off With an Announcement of the New Hardware Wallet	As virtually everyone in the crypto world knows, one of the most critical and persistent issues plaguing the space is wallet security. Problems abound: phishing, fraud, theft, hacking – all of these risks have to be taken into account by cryptocurrency holders. Experts estimate that more than a billion dollars have been stolen from crypto wallets just since the beginning of 2018. The best possible solution to these threats is a hardware wallet, which users have full control over, and this is just what’s being offered by a pioneering blockchain digital advertising distribution hub CryptoAds Marketplace.\nThe platform ensures its customers’ peace of mind by supplying them with a small device that they can store in a safe place or carry with them. The new hardware wallet will be protected with an encoded private key secured with a user-defined alpha-numeric password and will connect to a computer via Bluetooth. In the future, all users holding more than USD 200 in their accounts will be offered hardware wallets for free. The device will also be given as a gift to any CryptoAds token holder who buys more than USD 200 worth of CRAD tokens during the company’s ongoing Initial Coin Offering, which has now entered its public sale stage.CryptoAds Marketplace is creating the digital advertising world in which consumers can choose to look at targeted advertising and distributors are paid directly by brands to host their ads without endless brokerage fees that guzzle budgets. The platform enables marketers to roll out dynamic digital advertising strategies by giving them diverse branding opportunities in a wide variety of multimedia formats across an unlimited number of platforms.\nCryptoAds gives advertisers the opportunity to share native videos or in-app mobile ads, standard video clips, vertical and 360 video ads, offer walls, or any other digital advertising delivery system directly to websites and apps. Co-founder of Treascovery, Chidopi, and TimeBox, Jason Hung, who is also a CryptoAds advisor, says that he sees a lot of potential in the project’s capability to deliver for every stakeholder.\n“It’s a system that benefits all of the players,” he explains. “Advertisers can readily find quality publishers for their content, while website owners and other distributors can provide audience stats directly to potential marketers. At the same time, users engage only with the content they’re interested in. CryptoAds is paving the way of the future for digital advertising delivery, and I anticipate it will achieve increasing profitability for everyone who participates as the platform rolls out. And with their state-of-the-art hardware wallet, they are making the space safe and secure for all participants – something that is guaranteed to make users happy.”\nCryptoAds Marketplace is the brainchild of the same people behind the popular CallFreeCalls (CFC) VOIP app that offers free voice and text services for users, which is paid for by various sponsors. The original CFC platform, which has over 7 million users worldwide, will be ported over to the blockchain paradigm, making the B2C aspect of the project a truly symbiotic system that allows app users and gamers to accept various offers from advertisers in exchange for engaging with advertising content. That means users can access other services like video content or in-game products or the ability to level-up in their favorite game in exchange for watching ads made available through the CryptoAds dashboard. The platform will also feature a software development kit (SDK) that third parties can download in order to integrate CryptoAds into their own apps, so they can provide the same service for their users and receive rewards in return.\nBlockchain technology has allowed the team to up their game in the digital advertising distribution arena, since they can now integrate transparent smart-contract technology that pretty much puts an end to the need for intermediary brokers, who often take the lion’s share of a campaign’s budget before distributors are even paid, while virtually eliminating the opportunity for fraud. Their system will allow all of the players to rate one another, based on performance and value of offers. Advertisers and distributors can then make informed choices about which offers they wish to engage with.\nThe project is driven by the CRAD utility token, which is currently available for purchase via an open public sale, which will run until July 16. CryptoAds founder and CEO, Oleksii Vinogradov, says that they chose to hold the ICO in order to expand their user base, to continue to develop and scale their product, and to finally and definitively address the major security threats faced by the community.\n“It’s an exciting process to undertake,” he says. “We are just now launching our public ICO, and we’ve already received many offers to form strategic partnerships with various other blockchain companies that share our vision and could help our product’s positioning in the market. This tells me that what we’re offering will fill a critical gap in the ecosystem.”\nFor more information about CryptoAds, visit tokensale.cfc.io\nThe post CryptoAds’ Public Crowdsale Kicks off With an Announcement of the New Hardware Wallet appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/cryptoads-public-crowdsale-kicks-off-announcement-new-hardware-wallet/	2018-06-27 11:47:37+00	10
109	What Will New FSA Head Mean for Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchanges	As the position of minister of the FSA is about to change hands, questions about the future of regulations on cryptocurrency and blockchain based technology arise in Japan.\nJapan’s FSA to Change Hands\nAs the current minister of Japan’s Financial Security Agency, Nobuchika Mori, heads into what most assume will be his last week guiding the agency. He leaves behind big shoes to fill. As the longest-serving FSA minister and architect for much of Japan’s policy on cryptocurrency and blockchain based technology regulation, Mori is one of the most recognized Japanese officials outside of his country, at least to foreign fintech investors.\nDuring Mr. Mori’s tenure, normally conservative Japan embraced cryptocurrency as no other nation did. As other countries struggled to develop a framework for crypto policy, Japan took the honor and responsibilities of being the first major country to officially recognize Bitcoin as currency in April of 2017. While most countries ignored or made moves to outlaw cryptocurrency exchanges, the FSA took the bold steps of licensing theirs, starting in September last year with 11.\nMr. Mori’s aggressive policies came in the aftermath of the Mt. Gox debacle in 2014. Then the busiest Bitcoin exchange in the world suffered a digital heist that led to its collapse and the disappearance of over half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin. Fall out from the ensuing court cases of are still being felt today in Bitcoin market rates four years later.\nThat collapse and the legal ambiguity was what inspired the FSA, led on by Mori, to create real regulation and licensing of the market. This didn’t turn out to be a perfect solution though since only a few months after creating regulation another Japanese exchange, Coincheck, was hacked resulting in another half of a billion dollar yield for black hats.\nIn the aftermath of Coincheck a new round of regulatory changes was made. Mori took the brunt of the criticism as detractors said his pioneering policies had cost the public dearly.\nMori Will Name Successor\nMori’s enthusiasm for blockchain based industry is said to have come from a deeply felt fear that Japan had fallen behind in fintech. As head of the FSA he wanted to push the country’s financial sector to the head of the emerging blockchain technology curve. Now that he is stepping down and will handpick his replacement from within the FSA’s ranks. The question is what will his legacy be?\nWill Nobuchika Mori leave behind a regulatory atmosphere on cryptocurrency that becomes harder to manage and adapt since it was adapted from existing financial policy, thus leaving his replacement in a more difficult position than he himself was in? Or one that benefits from “wargaming in a safe environment” so that if a major financial crisis occurs the FSA will be ready, due to the workout Mori gave it on the nascent sector.\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post What Will New FSA Head Mean for Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchanges appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/what-will-new-fsa-head-mean-for-japanese-exchanges/	2018-06-27 11:00:03+00	10
111	Zcash (ZEC) Overwinter Upgrade Introduces Democratic Development Path	It is pertinent for all cryptocurrencies to continue evolving. In the case of ZCash, some major network upgrades have been introduced this week. Known as the Overwinter upgrade, it will bring more positive attention to this altcoin as a whole. \nThe Zcash Upgrade in a Nutshell\nFor a currency which has been around a while now, ZCash has not seen that many big upgrades. Rushing proper developments is not the right course of action, as a lot of decision-making is involved in the process. When the network hit block 47500 this week, the Overwinter protocol upgrade was officially introduced. It is comprised of a few different aspects which help shape the future of ZCash as a whole. \nFirst of all, there is an opt-in upgrade. This opt-in option is part of the two-tiered governance model introduced for future ZCash upgrades. Network nodes are not required to adhere to the latest rules, although it is still advised to do so regardless. This approach is an interesting social experiment. Very few – if any – other cryptocurrencies offer users a choice, as they usually have to adhere to the choice of the developers at all times. \nSecondly, there is an “educational” aspect to this new governance system. Anyone operating a node will receive all of the necessary information regarding the network and its future direction at all times. Ensuring users can make the right and informed decision is what the ZCash team strives to achieve moving forward. This should also reduce further issues regarding service providers not upgrading to a new set of protocol rules in the future. \nPaving the Future\nAll of these upgrades may seem insignificant to novice users. Even so, they present a completely different ecosystem for ZCash as a whole. A two-tiered governance model for protocol upgrades seems to be the right way to go at this time. There have been growing concerns among cryptocurrency users over how they are forced in a certain direction by developers. That is never the correct approach, for rather obvious reasons.\nAdditionally, this new upgrade also means legacy nodes will run out of “support” in the near future. While this will not affect funds or private keys created by these nodes, it is pertinent those users upgrade to the new client as soon as possible. This is a completely new era for the ZCash cryptocurrency and its underpinning technology. Whether or not any further major changes are to be expected, remains a bit unclear at this time.\nIt will be interesting to see how other developers perceive these protocol changes. Considering cryptocurrency is all about empowering the end user, such a governance model may make its way to different projects over time. In the case of Bitcoin, it seems unlikely any changes will occur anytime soon. However, for some of the more prominent altcoins, this may very well be an option worth looking into.\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Zcash (ZEC) Overwinter Upgrade Introduces Democratic Development Path appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/zcash-overwinter-upgrade-introduces-a-two-tiered-governance-model/	2018-06-27 12:00:21+00	9

115	Australian Central Bank Admires Bitcoin But Doesn’t See it Replacing Fiat	Central banks govern most of the country’s wealth, and thus most are feeling threatened by the exposure cryptocurrency has got in mainstream economics. Australian Central Bank’s opinion about cryptocurrency was stated to the Australian Business Economists in Sydney yesterday, 26th June.\nTony Richards, an official from the Reserve Bank of Australia said,\n“Even if one is quite skeptical of whether bitcoin will have a significant role in the economy in the future, I think it is hard to avoid some admiration for its design.”\nTony Richard is the head of Australia’s payment policy department and is known to own a small amount of bitcoin too which he acquired back in June 2014. \n “When a country doesn’t have a credible currency, then people might look for other ones. Whether those are cryptocurrencies or something like the US dollar is another issue, but we in Australia have a perfectly credible currency called the Australian dollar; we’ve had low and stable inflation for at least 25 years; and the likelihood that we’d have significant adoption of an alternative currency seems to be pretty low,” he continued.\nTony Richards may be a fan of Bitcoin; however, he notices that Bitcoin won’t have much to do for the people of Australia as they are pretty satisfied using the Australian Dollar.\nRichards also touched on the volatility issues of Bitcoin, and claimed that “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are yet to establish themselves as reliable stores of value.”\nRichards pointed out the higher transaction fees that undermine the legitimacy of Bitcoin.\nRichards proved to the public his knowledge by bringing front more technical issues of Bitcoin by saying,  “This episode points to the scalability and governance problems of the bitcoin system.“Bitcoin’s lack of a central governance structure has been a weakness in dealing with the capacity problem that results from the fact that the original protocol limits the block size to no more than 1 megabyte.”\nHe even spoke about the numerous security concerns which put Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies at risk. \n “And there have also been many hacks of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets over the past few years. That shows there is also a lot more risk in bitcoin intermediaries than there is in the supervised banks and financial institutions in which households can hold their Australian dollars.”\nHe cleared the air that the Australian Central Bank won’t be pursuing their own cryptocurrency.\n“So for the time being at least, consideration of a possible new electronic form of money provided by the Reserve Bank to households is not something that we are actively pursuing.”\nWhile Australian Central Bank’s official may not opt for cryptocurrency, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney has shown his interest in a central bank issued digital currency. \nCryptocurrencies will be helpful for most of the unbanked and are seen to hold a valid place in mainstream economics for people who don’t believe in the traditional banking system.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Australian Central Bank Admires Bitcoin But Doesn’t See it Replacing Fiat appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/australian-central-bank-admires-bitcoin-but-doesnt-see-it-replacing-fiat/	2018-06-27 12:02:58+00	0
116	Investments in Cryptocurrencies Expected to Double, According to ING Bank Survey	Dutch banking and financial services giant has recently hired a research company Ipsos to conduct a study on virtual currency perception in Europe, the United States and Australia. The results have just been published and they are encouraging – the interest in the budding industry is expected to double further down the road.\nDespite bitcoin and other digital currencies going through a torrid time and hovering around or below their yearly lows, the study gives us hope that a period of recovery and sustained growth might be just around the corner. \nThe study was conducted by questioning respondents in 13 European countries – Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom as well as Australia and the United States. Approximately a 1000 respondents have been surveyed in each country.\nAccording to the official report, “Sixty-six percent of people in Europe say they have heard of cryptocurrency. Fewer than one in 10 (9%) own it. An additional 16 percent say they expect to own it in future, which suggests uptake could more than double. Considering a third of those in Europe (34%) have not yet heard of cryptocurrency the growth potential could be even higher.“\nPerhaps a bit surprisingly, Turkey is the most crypto-savvy nation in Europe, with 18 percent of surveyed Turks owning virtual currencies and a further 45 percent expecting to acquire some in the future.\nEuropeans seem to favour cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, instead of considering them to be just an investment opportunity. Over one-third of respondents believe that digital currencies are the future of online spending and 30% of those polled in Europe would consider using crypto to pay for goods online. Notably, 15 percent of Europeans would even consider getting paid in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\nThe study has also revealed that the majority of respondents consider virtual currencies to be a riskier investment than real estate, bonds or stocks, which is totally understandable, having a recent crypto slump in mind. In addition, when considering a crypto investment, people tend to trust financial advisors and specialist websites instead of their friends and family.\nJessica Exton, a behavioral scientist concluded by saying that, “Cryptocurrency remains an abstract investment for many, but there may be more appetite for digital currencies than some might suggest. Based on our survey, ownership of cryptocurrencies could more than double in the future – although we do not know when.“\nImage Source: “Flickr”\n \nThe post Investments in Cryptocurrencies Expected to Double, According to ING Bank Survey appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/investments-in-cryptocurrencies-expected-to-double-according-to-ing-bank-survey/	2018-06-27 11:30:53+00	5

144	Florida Appoints Crypto Czar to ‘Scrutinize’ and Regulate Digital Currency	The state of Florida will be bringing in a state-specific cryptocurrency czar to closely manage and regulate the technology. This follows the SEC appointing a cryptocurrency chief earlier this month.\nFlorida Recognizes Crypto Growth\nFlorida Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Jimmy Patronis issued a statement today saying that he is creating the position of a ‘crypto czar’ in order to provide oversight on cryptocurrencies. In a move that appears to recognize the growing use of crypto payments, he said that Florida should not remain on the sidelines for this new technology. Patronis said:\n“I have directed my office to create a position that will oversee how current securities and insurance laws apply to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies as well as shape the future of these regulations in our state.”\nAny ICOs and cryptocurrency companies will also be under the supervision of the new crypto czar and will have to register with the Office of Financial Regulation (OFR).  The new role will bring the OFR and the Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) in order to make combined regulation and oversight.\nThe increase in use of cryptocurrencies was also part of the reason for creating the new role. Patronis highlighted the way that companies and even governments are utilizing this new technology. Outside of the state, the Arizona Senate passed a bill in February which will allow citizens to pay their taxes with Bitcoin.\n“Cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly accepted as forms of payment for many transactions across the state, including by government entities. The Seminole County Tax Collector announced that the office will accept bitcoin as payment for property taxes, identification cards and license plates,” he added.\nIn light of recent exposed frauds, such as Centra, and the SEC creating a fake ICO to warn investors of risks, Patronis pointed out the dangers of getting scammed. He said that the crypto czar will help protect citizens from scams. Through greater awareness of the issues, local regulators will be able to provide a faster response time to fraudulent behavior. He also stressed that it will not ‘deter innovation’.\n“We cannot allow the cryptocurrency industry to expand in Florida unfettered and unchecked with the potential for so many, including our large population of seniors, to be exploited. By taking an active, comprehensive and balanced approach, our state will provide an appropriate level of scrutiny for emerging digital asset technologies.”\nOn June 6, the SEC appointed a crypto chief to advise on issues surrounding blockchain technology. Valerie Szczepanik was named as the associate director of the Division of Corporation Finance and senior adviser for Digital Assets and Innovation. She will make sure that the SEC is clear over how securities law applies to digital currencies and will coordinate efforts across departments.\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Florida Appoints Crypto Czar to ‘Scrutinize’ and Regulate Digital Currency appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/florida-appoints-crypto-czar-scrutinize-regulate/	2018-06-27 14:00:37+00	41
146	How Businesses Can Maximize the Potential of Their Users’ Data	Data is a powerful weapon for businesses. It’s been relevant for decades, but it’s now becoming even more important as we head into the age of ‘big data’.\nIf businesses (of all sizes) want to stay ahead of the game, it’s going to be crucial that they understand how to manage data properly and really get the most out of this goldmine.\n‘Goldmine’ might not be the best analogy, though. Because while data is currently more useful than gold, it’s a lot less scarce. The amount of data we produce doubles in size every two years, and by 2020 it’s expected to hit about 44 trillion gigabytes per year.\nAnd most of that data isn’t hidden away anywhere. In fact, most businesses today have access to a glut of data that could be enormously valuable if used properly.\nThe data almost every business has stored in their systems can be used to market more accurately, drive better research and development, and get to know customers more intimately.\nThere’s no question that data can change the way businesses operate on a massive scale. The real question is, how?\nHow data can change businesses\nWithin five years, it’s expected that there will be about 20 billion connected Internet of Things devices. And by 2020, there will be more than 6 billion smartphone users in the world.\nThis means that people are generating colossal amounts of data every single day. This includes information about their likes and dislikes, hobbies, age, political views and a whole lot more.\nIf used ethically (and this is important), businesses can rely on this data to construct accurate, reliable profiles of their customers. These profiles can then be used to gain a number of big advantages.\nTargeting ads is one of the major benefits. If businesses understand what their customers are interested in and what demographics they belong to, it becomes much easier to tailor advertising towards them and show ads that are relevant and interesting for them.\nWe’re all familiar with the kinds of annoying, intrusive ads that litter the internet, trying to grab our interest for some product or service we couldn’t care less about. That’s often the result of businesses failing to understand their customers — probably as a result of poor data management.\nBy gaining a clearer understanding of their customer base, businesses can rely on more friendly and personal forms of advertising, methods based on building a relationship with customers and gaining their trust.\nA closer relationship with customers isn’t just an advantage for marketers. Businesses that closely understand their base can tailor their brand better and ensure that what they’re doing is in line with what people want.\nThey can also communicate better, in a way that feels personal instead of soulless and generic. This makes customers more likely to stick around and leads to an easier and more natural relationship that benefits both parties.\nResearch and development can also gain from this kind of deeper understanding. By learning what customers are interested in, and their desires, businesses can work on building products and services that match that. This keeps their buyers happy and their profits healthy.\nThere are many huge benefits for businesses that can learn how to harness and use data better. But how can they get to this point, and use data in a more efficient and productive way than the competition?\nOne way of getting ahead could be to combine online and offline data, and one company called O2OPay are among those working hard to build this kind of model.\nMixing online and offline data\nThe data out there can be split fairly neatly into two groups — online and offline.\nOnline data is the stuff we produce solely online. That includes social media data, searches on sites like Google, information about our chats and much more. It’s very useful, but it isn’t the whole picture.\nThe other type of data is offline. That includes information about users’ location, payments, and subscriptions and memberships to services.\nWhen businesses combine these two types of data, the result is a much fuller and richer customer profile than the one generated by focusing on just one type.\nBut it’s also important to use this data responsibly and honestly, so customers don’t feel like businesses are invading their privacy or spying on them. In the wake of scandals like the Facebook Cambridge Analytica story, people are more concerned about this than ever.\nSo how can this be done? Blockchain technology could be one way to achieve it.\nUsing blockchain to manage data\nO2OPay is one blockchain-based company aiming to make it easier for businesses to access and use data — online and offline.\nThrough their platform, customers actively share their data with businesses, minimizing the kind of shady ‘monitoring’ practices that have become so widely hated.\n\nO2O is clear about only sharing data their users allow, and only offering it to the companies that need it. They’ve pledged not to sell on user data without offering a reward to the person who provided it.\nEven better, with O2OPay users are rewarded for sharing with tokens that can be exchanged for fiat money. This way, they get paid and businesses get valuable data. When this data is used to improve services and marketing, the customer wins again.\n\nBlockchain’s decentralization and transparency help make this kind of system possible.\nAs data becomes more and more relevant in business and everyday life, we’ll need new technologies like this to make sure we get the most out of it.\nThe post How Businesses Can Maximize the Potential of Their Users’ Data appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/businesses-can-maximize-potential-users-data/	2018-06-27 17:36:59+00	10
147	A Fifth of UK Millennials Would Rather Invest in Bitcoin Than in Real Estate	Bitcoin, a digital asset most people would consider a high-risk investment, is progressively becoming an option for millennials who find that putting money into property is not the wisest choice. A research study conducted in the United Kingdom found that 21% of the population aged between 21 and 35 would rather invest in Bitcoin instead of property.\nBitcoin Is Better Than Real Estate for 21% of Millennials\nUK-based build-to-rent developer Get Living conducted a poll among 3,000 millennials to better understand their position on property investment. It found out that three-quarters said they believe there are more rewarding investments to be made than putting money into real estate.\nThe study found that 57% of millennials consider property a ‘high risk’ investment decision over the next five years and Bitcoin is seen as a better investment by 21% of them.\n“For Millennials the soaring performance of Bitcoin – followed by an almost equally profound correction – holds more intrigue than the prospect of steady growth in house prices. This translated to 27% of male Millennials polled believing Bitcoin represents a better investment than property.”\nOver a third of homeowner participants in the poll said that the value of their property dropped in first 12 months and 57% admitted to having underestimated the cost of buying their first home. Monthly costs for 45% of them are much higher than when they were renting and 49% lived in more convenient locations before becoming home owners.\nNeil Young, chief executive of Get Living, analyzed the insights into ‘a generation in the vanguard of the new on-demand subscription society.’\n“What we’ve found in this report is that ‘generation rent’ are cautious when it comes to property investment, are optimistic for the future and value the flexibility that renting offers. These shifts can’t be ignored.”\nRobert Shiller, the U.S. economist and Nobel Laureate for his work on speculative manias including the housing bubble, has been vocal about bitcoin, recently calling it an ‘epidemic of enthusiasm.’ The Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale University said Bitcoin is another attempt at reinventing money and that no one can explain how cryptocurrencies work.\nCryptocurrency entrepreneurs are addressing virtually every business sector, including the real estate market. WestLand Storage Company, who has been operating on real estate for over 17 years, has recently launched a blockchain-based technology that aims to decentralize the real estate market and tokenize any real estate.\nThe Floating Island Project, founded by billionaire cryptocurrency enthusiast Peter Thiel and Patri Friedman, is set to develop an off-shore housing that uses its own currency and operates outside of government regulations.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has just announced the arrests of over 35 dark web vendors, seizing cryptocurrency holdings from the arrested individuals. \nCryptocurrencies Taken from Dark Web Illicit Good Vendors\nYesterday, the U.S. DOJ released a statement, drawing attention to the conclusion of a year-long operation specifically targeting dark web vendors. \nAccording to the release, the DOJ, along with other American governmental agencies, like the U.S. Secret Service and the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit, investigated 65 targets. The 65 investigations led to the arrest of more than 35 individuals involved in illicit dealings. \nEnforcement officers disguised themselves as money launderers, building trust between the officers and dark web dealers, which are often put at a distance. As a result, the HSI agents utilizing this stratagem personally identified a multitude of vendors, creating a logical path to the over 35 arrests made. \nDeputy Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein addressed the case, adamantly declaring:\n“Criminals who think that they are safe on the darknet are wrong. We can expose their networks, and we are determined to bring them to justice.”\nAlong with the 35 arrests, law enforcement agents also seized a variety of assets from the indicted criminals. \nRosenstein, the aforementioned law enforcement agency, gave credence to the success of the operation, saying: \n“We seized their weapons, their drugs, and $23.6 million of their ill-gotten gains. This nationwide enforcement effort will reduce the supply of deadly drugs like fentanyl that are killing an unprecedented number of Americans.”\nThe seized assets, valued at over $23 million, included copious amounts of narcotics, 100 firearms, five vehicles, gold bars and U.S. dollars, and most importantly, a multitude of cryptocurrencies and mining machines that are collectively worth over $20 million.  \nBitcoin, But No Privacy Cryptocurrencies? \nThe release was not fully transparent about the exact specifics regarding the cryptocurrency holdings. However, it was noted that over 2,000 Bitcoins were seized, coming to a value of $12 million at today’s prices. It was also disclosed that the government is still seeking the forfeiture of an additional 4,000 Bitcoin from two criminals hailing from Maryland. \nSome found it odd that vendors on the dark web would use Bitcoin at all. Tech-savvy individuals have made it clear that it is possible to discern the identity of the people behind certain Bitcoin transactions. This factor has only added to the growing appeal for privacy-based cryptocurrencies, like Monero or Zcash, which allow for the introduction of higher levels of financial privacy. Despite the recent listing of Zcash on the U.S-based Gemini exchange, privacy coins have become a target for governmental regulation. \nThe Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA), recently introduced restrictions on exchanges operating in Japan, outright banning the offering of privacy coin trading. The FSA suggested that these cryptocurrencies introduce a high risk of money laundering and the funding of illegal activities, evidently something a government-run agency would want to crack down on. \nGovernmental worry regarding privacy coins has grown rapidly, with the U.S. government also indicating a growing worry for this rapidly expanding sub-industry. But users, even those who aren’t criminals, will continue to move to privacy cryptocurrencies, as they seek the financial privacy that traditional cash offers.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post US Agencies Seize Cryptocurrencies from Dark Web Vendors Valued Over $23 Million appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/us-agencies-seize-cryptocurrencies-from-dark-web-vendors-valued-over-23-million/	2018-06-27 21:15:12+00	13
153	Digital Payment Platform Uphold Inks Deal to Acquire New York Broker-Dealer	Uphold, a cloud-based financial services platform, has inked a deal to acquire New York-based broker-dealer JNK Securities Corp., in the latest move by a crypto platform to move itself towards traditional markets. \nThe deal, if approved, will give JNK clients access to crypto trading, potentially bringing new institutional investors to Uphold’s platform and the larger crypto ecosystem.\nUphold Acquiring JNK Securities\nAccording to Bloomberg, terms of the agreement have not yet been disclosed. If the deal gets the green light from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Uphold will then seek approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as an alternative trading system (ATS). Although not a public house (like the New York Stock Exchange), an ATS can provide many of the same functions of matching buyers with sellers of securities.\n\n“Many crypto assets (particularly ICO tokens) may be treated as securities in some cases,” Uphold CEO Adrian Steckel said in a statement. “Through Uphold’s new securities division, the digital currency platform would be able to offer sales and trading of ICO tokens and fractional equities and provide other exchange services.”\n\nUphold’s move follows similar acquisitions by larger U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges. Coinbase said earlier this month that it’s buying a trio of firms, including a broker-dealer, to offer customers blockchain-based securities. Around the same time as the Coinbase announcement, peer-to-peer trading platform Circle Internet Financial Ltd. said that it intends to pursue registration as a brokerage and trading venue with the SEC in attempts to help investors buy and sell tokens deemed to be securities.\nRegulated trading platforms like Uphold will likely be eventually handling billions of dollars in tokens sold by companies in initial coin offerings (ICOs). Despite a crackdown by the U.S., China, and other countries, startups raised more than $6.3 billion through ICOs in the first three months of the year, easily surpassing the total accumulated for the whole of 2017. \nThe SEC recently clarified that it considers most coins to be securities. This puts Uphold in a good position, as the SEC’s decision means issuers must register and comply with federal laws, as the platform is doing.\nUphold\nUphold, which brands itself as a ‘cloud money vault,’ is not strictly a cryptocurrency exchange. It’s more like a bank for buying and holding different currencies, converting them into other currencies, or sending them to other members internationally.\nThe site was launched in 2014 under the name Bitreserve, and was founded by CNET founder Halsey Minor. When it first launched, customers had to make their first deposits in Bitcoin, but could then convert Bitcoin into other digital (or fiat) currencies when they wanted to withdraw funds or send money abroad.\nIn 2015, Bitreserve changed its name to Uphold and began allowing customers to deposit money into their accounts via bank transfer or credit or debit cards. With the boom in cryptocurrencies over the past year, the platform is certainly embracing the nascent industry. Uphold’s website declares that users can go, ‘from U.S. dollar to bitcoin in seconds.’\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Digital Payment Platform Uphold Inks Deal to Acquire New York Broker-Dealer appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/digital-payment-platform-uphold-inks-deal-to-acquire-new-york-broker-dealer/	2018-06-27 23:15:21+00	10

145	Can a New Blockchain Counter the Quantum Computing Threat	There has been a strong focus on the effects of quantum computing on blockchain technology. More specifically, there is a strong belief these developments in computing can effectively “break” the cryptography underpinning distributed ledgers. The QRL Foundation has come up with a potential solution in this regard, which is well worth keeping an eye on.\nQuantum Computing is a Threat\nWhile not everyone may be aware of it, blockchains and quantum computing don’t mix well. Every blockchain is powered by mathematics and cryptography. To most people, that latter part seems unbreakable, but the reality is very different. Standard cryptographic functions cannot be broken by regular computers all that easily, but quantum devices are a different matter altogether.\nWhen this “break” will happen exactly, remains to be seen. Powerful quantum computers are still in active development as of right now. Moreover, they may not necessarily be used to break standard cryptography anytime soon either. However, it seems inevitable things will head in such a direction sooner or later.\nAs such, it is important to protect existing blockchains from this looming threat. Quantum blockchains are one way to go, although the research is still in the very early stages right now. Another option is to develop other solutions which can negate this threat for the foreseeable future. It appears that is exactly what the QRL Foundation has been working on behind the scenes. \nQRL Foundation has a Plan\nAccording to a new blog post, the QRL Foundation has come up with a solution to counter quantum computing. Its Quantum Resistant Ledger is resistant to quantum and traditional computing attacks. This entire ecosystem has been thoroughly audited by Red4Sec, a well-known cyber-security company. Adam Koltun comments on this project;\n“At our core, we are a quantum-resistant blockchain; more secure and future-oriented than other blockchains out there today. If a person or organization wants to build a secondary-layer application on top of a blockchain, then QRL’s rock-solid security and open source orientation makes us an ideal platform.”\nUnder the hood, QRL utilizes the Extended Merkle signature scheme. This will prevent most quantum computing attacks from breaking its cryptography. Additionally, this new ledger will also support smart contract functionality in the future. Surprisingly, it seems the developers also contemplate switching to Proof-of-Stake in the future. This latter approach should be finalized in the coming twelve months.\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Can a New Blockchain Counter the Quantum Computing Threat appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/qrl-foundation-claims-its-new-blockchain-can-defy-quantum-computing-attacks/	2018-06-27 13:00:41+00	19

151	The Swiss Alps Holds the Key to Storing Crypto Assets for Investors	Swiss Alps: A military-grade bunker has opened its vaults to permit wealthy cryptocurrency investors to securely store their coins. Think of the operation as a sort-of Swiss bank account for digital assets. \nSwiss Crypto Vault\nBecause the Swiss Crypto Vault doesn’t mix client’s digital assets with the company’s own, it doesn’t need a banking license to operate. This has permitted the Vault to position itself as a quasi-private bank for coins when most traditional banks refuse to hold them. The Vault also services a growing need from high net worth individuals (HNWIs), hedge funds, and the like, to securely store large amounts of cryptocurrencies which are often targeted by hackers. \nSafety and security for crypto asset holders is paramount. Not only have there been hacks and thefts of online exchanges and wallets, there have even been instances where criminals have forced themselves into peoples homes and demanded the private keys necessary to access the homeowners crypto funds. \nThe Vault, and alternatives like rival Xapo — which also operates out of a similar decommissioned military bunker — come as a growing number of HNWIs and institutions are investing in blockchain-based startups via initial coin offerings (ICOs).\nICOs, where startups generate public funds by offering tokens that can be used to operate new technologies or simply to trade for potential profits, are a massive growth sector for the cryptocurrency industry. The crowdfunding method raised some $6.3 billion in the first three months of this year, easily surpassing the total accumulated for the whole of 2017. According to experts, more than 80% of these funds are being generated by HNWIs and professional investors.\nSwitzerland’s Perfect Storm\nSwitzerland’s reputation for being a crypto-friendly destination as well as a place with growing blockchain expertise led Swiss Crypto Vault to bury its ‘banking grade’ servers in a secret location in the Alps. To access their funds, clients utilize a special web portal that permits them to withdraw coins from anywhere in the world.\n\nAs is often the case with these vaults, an extra layer of security requires the client, Swiss Crypto Vault, and also a third-party handling partner to simultaneously verify withdrawals. This is somewhat similar to the system of multiple key holders being needed to open a safe deposit box in a bank vault.\nSwiss Crypto Vault is a joint venture between Zug-based crypto financial services firm Bitcoin Suisse and Swiss Gold Safe, a company that stores precious metals, art, and other valuables in Alpine vaults. Currently, clients can store Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Litecoin, Ethereum, and all ERC20/233 tokens. The Vault plans to add more options in the future.\nDespite the fact that Swiss Crypto Vault considers its setup unique, other companies are utilizing similar technologies to safeguard cryptocurrencies too. Zug-based Crypto Storage is one, and also the state-controlled telecoms provider Swisscom. The newly-formed Swisscom Blockchain division has teamed up with hardware and software manufacturers to provide a secure storage service for big investors.\n\n“People are now investing millions into tokens,” CEO of Swisscom Blockchain division Daniel Haudenschild, said, according to Swissinfo. “As soon as you get to such volumes, the usual methods of storing these assets are no longer viable.”\n“We have a window of a few years before large providers start offering crypto vault services on an industrial scale. Until the big players also start making this service available, this will be a premium business line for those financial institutions that are willing to offer it to their clients.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post The Swiss Alps Holds the Key to Storing Crypto Assets for Investors appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/the-swiss-alps-holds-the-key-to-storing-crypto-assets-for-investors/	2018-06-27 19:01:29+00	11

172	$20 Million Worth of Bitcoin Seized in a Crackdown on Dark Web Vendors	The US Department of Justice (DOJ) in tandem with numerous other state agencies, such as Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) have arrested 35 dark web traders across the United States. \nThe undercover operations saw agents posing as money launderers on dark web marketplaces, where they managed to identify vendors of illicit products. Even though cryptocurrencies are often portrayed in Hollywood and popular media as a means to pay for drugs or guns on the dark web, the reality is that less than 1 percent of all BTC transactions are used for funding unlawful activities.\nNonetheless, the dark web still exists and a number of alleged criminals will likely face jail time, while the rest will surely feel anxious after hearing such news. According to the official announcement, the officials confiscated 3.6 million worth of USD and gold, a bunch of weapons including a grenade launcher, drugs, pill pressers and 2000 BTC plus other digital currencies, worth around $20 million in total.\nSpeaking on the success of the operation Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein said that, “Criminals who think that they are safe on the Darknet are wrong. We can expose their networks, and we are determined to bring them to justice. Today, we arrested more than 35 alleged Darknet vendors. We seized their weapons, their drugs, and $23.6 million of their ill-gotten gains.“\nHSI Executive Associate Director Derek Benner added that, “The Darknet is ever-changing and increasingly more intricate, making locating and targeting those selling illicit items on this platform more complicated. But in this case, HSI special agents were able to walk amongst those in the cyber underworld to find those vendors who sell highly addictive drugs for a profit. […] HSI has infiltrated the Darknet, and together with its law enforcement partners nationwide, it has proven, once again, that every criminal is within arm’s reach of the law.“\nThe overwhelming majority of BTC and other digital currencies that were seized, belonged to 2 of the 35 arrested vendors – Maryland residents Ryan Farace and Robert Swain. According to the indictment, “Farace distributed alprazolam tablets through sales on the dark web in exchange for Bitcoin, and that Farace and Swain laundered the drug proceeds through financial transactions designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.“\nThis is not the first time US authorities seize BTC and other cryptocurrencies in a dark web operation. The most notable case was the arrest of the owner of now-defunct Silk Road – the biggest dark web marketplace at the time. US Government seized a staggering 80,000 BTC at the time and auctioned them from 2013 to 2014. Earlier this year, an auction of over 3,800 BTC was held by the US Marshal Service.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post $20 Million Worth of Bitcoin Seized in a Crackdown on Dark Web Vendors appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/20-million-worth-of-bitcoin-seized-in-a-crackdown-on-dark-web-vendors/	2018-06-27 18:30:37+00	1
173	Malta Passes Crypto Friendly Regulations	Malta has lately been trying to establish the island nation as a haven for cryptocurrency businesses seeking more lax regulations and the ability to operate more freely. \nBinance moved from Hong Kong to Malta earlier this year due to the island nation’s friendly cryptocurrency-related jurisdictions, and a Bloomberg report has noted that a majority of the world’s cryptocurrency was being traded through Malta – at least legally speaking.\n\nIt would seem that Malta has no intention of stopping this campaign, as the Maltese parliament held a vote on three blockchain and cryptocurrency bills yesterday, which passed unanimously.\n\nThe bills are specifically meant to boost Malta’s attractiveness even further in relation to blockchain firms and will make it easier to start blockchain and cryptocurrency companies in Malta.\n\nMalta’s Parliament Secretary for Digital Innovation, Silvio Schembri, tweeted that he was ”honored to have driven these bills” through the Maltese parliament, and expressed gratitude to all those involved with the project.\n\nMoreover, Schembri also announced that the ”Malta Digital Innovation Authority” which will be created following this vote, will be led by Mr. Stephen McCarty. Schemers was also adamant that these bills will give the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology the means to flourish.\n\nThe first of these bills was dubbed the Malta Digital Innovation Authority Bill and brings a wide array of cryptocurrency-related regulations. More specifically, it also entails the creation of the authority which McCarty will now lead as CEO.\n\nIn addition to this, the affairs of the Malta Digital Innovation Authority will be carried out by a board of governors. The authority will also survey and certify DLT platforms, in order to “ensure credibility”.\n\nAnother of the three bills was the Technology Arrangements and Services Bill, which is meant to address the possibility of allowing so-called “Technology Service Providers” and “Technology Arrangements” to have the Technological Arrangement being granted. Separate legal personality.\n\nMoreover, the Virtual Financial Assets Bill was the third bill, which focused on regulations pertaining to initial coin offerings (ICOs). Furthermore, this bill will deal with the regulatory framework that cryptocurrency exchanges will fall under.\n\nMaltese comments in regards to the bills have already been overwhelmingly positive, which certainly highlight the attitude of the Maltese government. \n\nMoreover, as Malta has already attracted several big players within in cryptocurrency field, these latest pieces of legislation should not come as a surprise. Nonetheless, it will be interesting to see what further steps Malta takes to become the undisputed “cryptocurrency capital” of Europe.\n\nToday Maltese Parliament unanimously approved 3 bills on DLT/blockchain, a 1st in the World. Honored to have driven these bills. Announced that Mr Stephen McCarthy will be the CEO of the new #Malta Digital Innovation Authority.  #BlockchainIsland -SS\n— Silvio Schembri (@SilvioSchembri) June 26, 2018\n\nImage Source: “Flickr”\n \nThe post Malta Passes Crypto Friendly Regulations appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/malta-passes-crypto-friendly-regulations/	2018-06-27 18:13:20+00	16

150	BitPico Ready to Launch a 51% Attack on Bitcoin Cash: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Technical Analysis (June 28, 2018)	There is a supremacy “war” going on between BTC and Bitcoin Cash but the common thing is that both are bleeding. At current prices, $600 is but some ticks away and that means caution since there have been reaction at this level when we point out Bitcoin Cash daily price chart. Today, I propose staying neutral with the usual bearish skew. That’s unless there is a spike breaking above $850, our immediate resistance line which also doubles up as a bull trigger line.\nFrom the News\nSo, just like big banks-whose failure can cause an economic meltdown-are subject to stress tests, BitPico plans to unleash their attack nodes. Their overall objectives are simple: stress test Roger Ver’s Bitcoin Cash network.\nBitPico are a group of developers who are clearly-pro Bitcoin (BTC) and with their planned attack, they are ready to show the whole world how “easy it is to take down the Bitcoin Cash network” and make “Roger Ver Cry”. This seems to be a retaliation and a show of proof following Bitcoin Cash claims that they indeed did their own stress test. In their response, BitPico says their independent tests will go on to show how Bitcoin Cash is “centralized and controlled”. Already this promises to be an interesting event. Like all stress tests, the results following this intentional attack would reveal the depth and robustness of the Bitcoin Cash network.\n\nWe've created a @github repository for the Stage 1 #bcash $bch network test toolkit. https://t.co/X5hHXoWJSf Hopefully others will compile and help test once pushed. We expect 1 stage every 28 days until all 3 stages are running in-parallel. #cryptocurrency #cybersecurity \n— ɃitPico (@bitPico) June 24, 2018\n\nThe members behind this group are strong supporters of Segwit 2x and Bitcoin’s LN development. However, despite disappointing events following issues around Segwit 2X implementation-that eventually birthed BCH, the fact that Segwit is live is overly positive. After adoption by full nodes, settlement time and network fees have seen significant improvements. In fact statistics shows that Bitcoin fees were once lower than Bitcoin Cash’s at some point.\n\nThe #bcash $bch @bitcoin attack has been started; it will continue to run as we work to amplify it over the coming months. We expect to have 5000 Bcash attack nodes in roughly 6 weeks and then we will multi-fork the chain. @rogerkver will now cry . #hacking #skills #security pic.twitter.com/dR8ksy6Lz8\n— ɃitPico (@bitPico) June 22, 2018\n\nIn a series of tweets, the core members of BitPico whose identities are not yet available to the public said they are ready to carry out a 51 percent attack. Unfortunately for Bitcoin Cash, these guys know their thing. They have successfully stress-tested Bitcoin’s Lightning Network after launching a coordinated attack receiving applause from Andreas Antonopoulos in the process.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Technical Analysis\nWeekly Chart\nBitcoin Cash Weekly Chart by Trading View\nRegardless of the drama and shills, the fact that BCH is on free fall is a cause of concern. Week over week, statistics from different coin trackers shows that it is down 20 percent and complementing last week’s bear pressure. While we remain bearish until we see hints of higher highs, the simple fact that we are so close to the main support line at $600 as the weekly chart shows means either we lock in some profits or pause taking shorts for the time being.\nDaily Chart\nBitcoin Cash Daily Chart by Trading View\nLike it has been the case in the past two months after prices peaked in late April, sellers are in charge. As aforementioned, either we take a wait and see approach as bears test $600 or sell and aim for $300 with sell profits locked. The reasoning is simple, $600 like $6,000 in BTC are influential price tags and regions of strong technical support. Now, should there be a depreciation below them, aim for $300 which is also Bitcoin Cash all-time lows.\nThe post BitPico Ready to Launch a 51% Attack on Bitcoin Cash: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Technical Analysis (June 28, 2018) appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/bitcoin-cash-bch-technical-analysis-june-28-2018/	2018-06-28 00:04:57+00	15

Besides, there is VW formation of NAV seeking to bring standardization in the AV systems. All these should be positive and perhaps that is why prices are a little bit stable as they test key support lines.\nLet’s have a look at these charts:\nEOS Technical Analysis\nEOS Daily Chart by Trading View\nTwo weeks after launch and EOS is chocking with centralization accusations and human involvement in governance in a sphere that is supposed to run on autopilot. That everything should be dry and coin holders are solely responsible for their own coins’ private keys.\nOf course, we may argue that change is after all good but what with all these internal wrangles and law suit threats when orders from the ECAF fails to be implemented? What with the constitution that gives too much power to but a few validators all in the name of throughput and scalability? If this was the case, many strongly believe that Block One should have reconsidered setting up a blockchain based company and instead go for a centralized app. This will allow them to suspend accounts even on trivial matters negating the very core of blockchain which is decentralization, transparency and responsibility.\n\nWhat a surprise that just 2 weeks after launching, #EOS is considering scrapping its entire “constitution” and starting over. (Source: https://t.co/z5abgMhyPP) pic.twitter.com/cYoH7w93zL\n— Jackson Palmer (@ummjackson) June 27, 2018\n\nJudging from price action, it has been a bad month for EOS. As a matter of fact, at current spot prices, EOS is down more than 60 percent from their ATHs. It could get worse because as it stands and especially after June 26 slide, $4 is most likely the next target meaning yesterday’s trade plan is valid. The only time our stand would change is when we see movement above $9. Notwithstanding, note that at current prices, there is more impetus for potential reversals because $7 is our intermittent support line.\nLitecoin (LTC) Technical Analysis\nLitecoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nIn a new twist and obvious reconsideration, Facebook being a for-profit company is reversing their cryptocurrency ban. This comes five months after barring legitimate companies from advertising their services/products at their platform.\n\nBREAKING: Facebook is reversing its ban on #crypto-related ads.\nIn and of itself this isn't a huge deal, but I'm hopeful it will send a signal to others that crypto is here to stay. Blockchain tech, tokenization &amp; cryptocurrency will touch every aspect of our lives.#BULLISH\n— Chris Koerner | ICO Advisor | Altcoin Expert (@noBScrypto) June 26, 2018\n\nIn a blog post, their product manager said that even though their initial policy was “intentional broad” to detect fraud as much as possible, they are now allowing approved crypto companies to advertise their coin. However, not everyone have a free pass.  Facebook are categorical stating that those who intends to should first fill a form for credibility. In it they should providence license evidence and state whether they are tradable at any public crypto exchange for permission.\nDespite the slowdown in price erosion, our previous trade plan holds true. This is so because LTC prices are still trading below the lower level of resistance at $90. Now to sync with our previous forecasts, as long as bears retain LTC valuation below this buy trigger line, we should be comfortable selling with targets at $70. It is the first support line. Should there be further sells, then $50 would be another target for sellers. All this time, safe stops would be at June 26 highs at $85. Obviously, any push above $90 cancels this short to medium term short evaluation.\nStellar Lumens (XLM) Technical Analysis\nStellar Lumens Daily Chart by Trading View\nBased on technical formations and the reluctance of buyers to push prices above 20 cents, our previous trade plans remains valid. It’s a simplistic approach. Thanks to recent tight trading, our decisions are all subject to buy pressure reversing losses and printing XLM prices above 20 cents. This is a minor but immediate resistance line. Therefore, as long as XLM prices struggles below June 26 prices, selling at lower time frames with targets at 15 cents and 8 cents as before is but valid.\nTron (TRX) Technical Analysis\nTron Daily Chart by Trading View\nNow, while there are no official announcements from Tron about their partnership with Pornhub partnership. In all honesty, it’s negative if at all Tron is going to attract big money. Porn is acceptable in the internet-that’s a fact but many big investment funds label Pornhub business plan “immoral”. The prospect of Tron partnering with a porn vendor is unacceptable to them.\n\nPornhub and TRON (TRX): The Future Has Come…Again. @tronfoundation accepted soon on Premium pic.twitter.com/EzGRjSsJTH\n— Pornhub ARIA (@Pornhub) June 27, 2018\n\nAt a glance, statistics shows that TRX is down five percent in the last 24 hours and below the main support line at 4 cents. Now, in line with our previous trade plan(s), my recommendation is simple: Sell and trade with the trend. Safe stops should be at June 26 highs at 4.3 cents while targets remains unchanged at Q1 2018 lows.\nIOTA (IOT) Technical Analysis\nIOTA Daily Chart by Trading View\nThere are many practical user case applications of IOTA. And thanks to the many partnerships in the first half of 2018, there is enough evidence for that.\n\n#Volkswagen &amp; #Audi Employees Being Coached on #IOTA (#MIOTA). For #carProducer the #tangle's #DataMarketplace is perfect standard protocol enabeling #OTA-updates, #m2m payments, #SmartCharging in #SmartCities &amp; other #AI-Apps w/in #cars. @iotatokennews https://t.co/wvpxRym8Hk\n— Stefan Hein (@stuard_mace) June 27, 2018\n\nThere are even better news because VW, the giant automaker keen on making technological strides in the autonomous vehicles leveraging on the Tangle teamed up with four suppliers including Bosch forming the Networking for Autonomous Vehicles (NAV). These are all positive to Tangle but unfortunately, we need to see that translating and supporting price.\nIn the last 24 hours for example, IOTA prices are down three percent finding temporary support at 90 cents though trading below the psychological $1 mark. Because of this and the general low volatility, we retain our bearish stand waiting for: breakouts below 90 cents endorsing our initial trade plan with targets at 70 cents or supports with rejection of lower lows pushing prices above $1.18 canceling this bearish projection. It’s that simple but still, patience is needed.\nThe post “Tron-Pornhub Partnership Might Repel Corporate Involvement Hurting TRX Prices”: IOTA, EOS, Stellar Lumens, Tron and Litecoin Technical Analysis appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/iota-eos-stellar-tron-litecoin-technical-analysis/	2018-06-28 00:02:28+00	13
149	This Is How Coinbase’s CEO Aims to End Poverty with GiveCrypto Charity	The CEO of a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange is launching a charity to help people in poverty, and is aiming to raise $1 billion in the next two years.\nUsing Crypto to Raise Funds\nGiveCrypto is a new nonprofit charity that distributes cryptocurrency to people in poverty. Launched today and founded by Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, the aim is to financially empower people who need it the most around the world. Cryptocurrencies that the charity accepts include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Zcash.\nInterestingly, while two billion people have a smartphone, over 1.7 billion adults worldwide don’t have access to basic financial services, according to the World Bank’s Global Financial Inclusion Database.\nFinancial services is something that many of us take for granted, and back in January, Armstrong wrote a blog on how he thought charitable giving could work in the crypto world. At the time, he said that most charities don’t accept digital currency, and those that do often sell crypto donations into fiat to be used straight away. Yet, he believes that due to the wealth cryptocurrency has produced there is a rare opportunity to create a nonprofit fund.\nFast-forward six months and we have the birth of GiveCrypto. By giving donations in cryptocurrency the charity can distribute payments to people all around the world. All that’s needed is a mobile device with an Internet connection. The charity is aspiring to raise $10 million by the end of this year, and $1 billion in the next two years. Armstrong notes that he’s personally donated $1 million to the project.\n“I’m passionate about unlocking the potential in cryptocurrency,” he wrote in a blog today. “When I first read the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper for bitcoin, I realized it represented an opportunity to bring economic freedom to people all over the world.”\nDirect Cash Transfers\nUnlike traditional charities, which use large resources to cover overheads, Armstrong points to research that suggests direct cash transfers are an effective way of giving and ending poverty. Additionally, when distributing aid to foreign countries, high fees and corruption are unfortunate occurrences he states. Cryptocurrency, however, is a way of solving these problems.\nAccording to Armstrong, there are three things likely to happen once a person receives a donation: they will either cashout to their local currency to buy what they need; hodl their coins to reap future benefits; or undertake crypto-to-crypto transfers to initiate local crypto economies.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post This Is How Coinbase’s CEO Aims to End Poverty with GiveCrypto Charity appeared first on NewsBTC.	\N	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/this-is-how-coinbases-ceo-aims-to-end-poverty-with-givecrypto-charity/	2018-06-27 20:10:05+00	13

171	Silicon Valley Giant Andreessen Horowitz Launches $300 Million “all weather” Crypto Fund	One of Silicon Valley’s biggest tech and investment firms, Andreessen Horowitz, has announced the creation of a crypto investment fund worth $300 million. The firm has described this as an “all weather” fund which will continue to invest, no matter what the market is doing.\nThe company’s announcement should be greeted with enthusiasm by the crypto-community which has seen prices consistently falling over the last few weeks. The price of bitcoin is hovering around the six-thousand-dollar mark at the moment, a spectacular tumble since the dizzy heights of $19k in December.\nAndreessen Horowitz, or “A16Z” as it is known, has a history of bullishness regarding crypto. It has made numerous strategic investments over the years in huge companies including Coinbase and Facebook. General Partner and board member Balaji Srinivasan is running Earn.com, which is now a Coinbase portfolio company.\nIn this latest round of crypto-bullishness, the company, in addition to creating this $300 million fund, has hired a new General Partner, Katie Haun. As well as being the firm’s first ever female GP, she boasts impressive credentials; she is a former federal prosecutor who had a significant hand in leading the case against dark-net marketplace Silk Road, as well as controversy-soaked exchange BTC-e.\nExplaining why the company was creating the fund, A16Z highlighted the novelty of trust as a primitive that blockchain exploits. This leads to a unique relationship between developers, users and the platform, a relationship which can be applied to a broad range of use-cases across many fields. In explaining what they believe the importance of the development path is, the firm stated:\n“In an era in which the internet is increasingly controlled by a handful of large tech incumbents, it’s more important than ever to create the right economic conditions for developers, creators, and entrepreneurs.”\nThe fund’s long-term focus makes its investment an “all weather” fund, according to the company. It will be investing in projects both at the genesis phase of development, to those which are already off the ground – so-called non-speculative investments. The crypto-winter which has set in since January has not tempered the bullish outlook at the company and so investment by the fund will continue whatever the weather in the market.\n“We have an “all weather” fund. We plan to invest consistently over time, regardless of market conditions. If there is another crypto winter, we’ll keep investing aggressively.”\nThe firm’s announcement raises hopes for an end to the bear market which has endured for the first half of the year. It also highlights that the firm sees development of use-cases as critical to development of the crypto-ecosystem. As reported in ToshiTimes yesterday, Ben Davenport of BitGo theorized that the value of use cases was rather negligible compared to the value of HODLing; A16Z’s investment into the space clearly shows the contrary: a belief in the value of use cases.\n“We want services powered by crypto protocols to be used by hundreds of millions and eventually billions of people. Crypto tokens are the native asset class of digital networks, but their value is driven by the underlying, practical uses cases.”\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Silicon Valley Giant Andreessen Horowitz Launches $300 Million “all weather” Crypto Fund appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/silicon-valley-giant-andreessen-horowitz-launches-300-million-all-weather-crypto-fund/	2018-06-27 15:32:03+00	5

170	Nobel Prize-winning Economist Robert Shiller Calls Bitcoin a ‘Social Movement’	Yale’s Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller spoke out on the Bitcoin phenomenon in an interview to Bloomberg on Tuesday, June 26th. The economist calls the cryptocurrency a social movement and an epidemic of enthusiasm. Shiller has previously explained his outlook on crypto and stays consistent with his views. The Nobel prize winner and Yale Sterling Professor of Economics claims that the Bitcoin phenomenon fundamentally is a speculative bubble.\nIn the television interview, Shiller agreed to the statement of Bitcoin being a generational phenomenon. He also pointed out a geographical division in the popularity of the technology. \n“It is generational and geographic. East coast is less into it than the West coast. Silicon Valley is really into it.”\nSuch unsystematic behavior in the adoption of the cryptocurrencies serves as an indicator of irrational response to a new information, according to Yale’s professor. Shiller recognizes the nature of a speculative bubble due to exclusive demographics of Bitcoin. Similar to the historical study cases, that the Nobel prize Laureate often capitalizes on, Shiller points out periodic reoccurrences of major price drops, exemplary of speculative behavior. He referred to a drastic decline in the bitcoin prize in 2013, famously plummeting down from the handsome $1 163 to $152 US. The bear market over 411 days happened in the wake of Mt Gox exchange collapse.\nDuring the interview, Shiller was asked to draw a parallel between the incident of tulip mania and the surge of cryptocurrencies. Shiller responded in a sarcastic manner. \n“I don’t know what it means to equate it to that. And by the way, tulips are still valued, there are still some expensive tulips.”\nThe economist also provided a more elaborate explanation. Shiller makes a point that the cryptocurrency innovations have drawn disproportionate and undeserved attention because of investors’ will to grow rich immediately.\n“There is also some impressive cryptographic theory that is coming out of computer scientists. This particular invention has so much more attention. Do you know what is going on inside of your laptop? There are millions of interesting stories about brilliant engineering devices that are in there. But we do not hear about them, that is because they are not part of a bubble. They are not part of investment excitement about a possibility of getting rich over this.”\nRobert James Shiller Shiller jointly received the 2013 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, “for their empirical analysis of asset prices”. as a Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale University and runs an investment management firm MacroMarkets LLC. He is known for prediction of dotcom and housing bubbles and warning about the crises when the bubbles burst. Shiller is often quoted stating Bitcoin being the biggest financial bubble at present. The economist uses the empirical approach in his analysis and bases conclusions on the failed monetary examples of 19th and 20th centuries, often appealing to the works of historical figures, such as Karl Marx and Robert Owen.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Nobel Prize-winning Economist Robert Shiller Calls Bitcoin a ‘Social Movement’ appeared first on Toshi Times.	\N	https://toshitimes.com/nobel-prize-winning-economist-robert-shiller-calls-bitcoin-a-social-movement/	2018-06-27 16:11:23+00	0

175	The Founder of EOS Proposes a New Constitution. The Current One is Overly Broad.	Dan Larimer, CTO at Block.one and inventor of EOS network, proposed the removal of the current version of the EOS constitution. Larimer wrote a Medium post where he reviews the current issues with governance of the newly-launched blockchain. In conclusion he proposes an updated draft of the constitution where the terms that could not be enforced by code were removed. Furthermore, more power has been delegated to the block producers, who conceivably will be in charge of solving disputes of intent in code. “Producers are in charge because that is reality”  — noted the EOS founder in a conversation held in the EOSGov Telegram channel. \nThe rework of the EOS constitution proposed by Dan Larimer focuses on maximizing the principle of Code-is-Law. Larimer reflects on the disputes arisen after the recent community-driven launch of the own blockchain and governance system.\n“From watching the community launch an EOS.IO based blockchain, Block.one has learned a lot already. We have seen that if you give people arbitrary power to resolve arbitrary disputes then everything becomes a dispute and the decisions made are arbitrary.”\nIn the new constitution Larimer aspires to have all contractual terms to be laid out by code yet transparent through documenting the intent of the code into the smart Ricardian contract blockchain. Dan dictates the official position of Block.one and calls for ‘an end of arbitration orders other than non-binding opinions on the intent of the code’. The block.one CTO proposes the arbitration power to be delegated to a super majority of the jury of block producers, namely 2/3+1 of the votes. This power, according to Larimer, needs to be exercised only for fixing the issues stemming from differences between code and intent, such as code vulnerabilities and contract bugs that may lead to major hacks of the network (e.g. the DAO hack on the Ethereum).\nThe governance model has become the subject of a large controversy in the past weeks following the launch of the EOS network. The block producers froze funds a number of accounts that were identified to be a subject to phishing scam. In the first instance, the measures were taken in violation of the EOS constitution and the required order from the arbitration body, ECAF, came retrospectively. In the second instance, the block producers obeyed the order issued by ECAF and froze 27 more fraudulent accounts. The statement contained no explanation for the specified measures. The aforementioned incidents raised the concerns of the community over the level of transparency and coming from the Arbitration Forum, as well as the general implications on the decentralization of the system. \nLarimer also suggests block producers to donate a part of their profits to the people who fell victims to the scam that provided users fake public/private keys. EOS inventor claims that interventions on-chain would do more damage to the EOS ecosystem. The inventor of the said ecosystem seeks alternatives to the central arbitration system. Larimer suggests a model, where users would be able to opt an organization of choice to arbitrate disputes over stolen keys. \nAccording to the current EOS constitution, the amending its content will require a vote of no less than 15% vote participation among tokens and no fewer than 10% more Yes than No votes, sustained for 30 continuous days within a 120 day period. The short yet vivid history of voting on EOS blockchain has shown that it may be challenging for Dan Larimer to achieve a majority on a potential referendum for a permanent draft of the constitution. It took EOS two weeks to get 15% of the votes for their Block Producers. The new vote would need the majority to remain unbroken for a month. \nSam Sapoznick, the person who signed the last order in the capacity of ECAF Interim Emergency Arbitrator has spoken out on the proposal in the EOSGov Telegram channel. \n“Dan’s proposal will (and ought to be) carefully analyzed, questioned, and if needed, revised, like any other community-sourced proposal would be. Dan’s follow-up post, delivered very timely, operates at a deeper level than the current community emotional response against ECAF and I think moves the overall governance discourse forward in a productive fashion.”\nImage SourcE: “Flickr”\nThe post The Founder of EOS Proposes a New Constitution.
