63	ReddCoin	RDD	70	28808713174	28808713174	\N	1530508148	118	Reddcoin is powered by its users. With Reddcoin, you are essentially your own bank.\nReddcoin is dedicated to one thing – tipping on social networks as a way to bring cryptocurrency awareness and experience to the general public. Social networks are now part of our everyday lives. They give every person on this planet a fair chance at showing the world how awesome they are. Getting an upvote, like, or retweet for your well-received comment or picture is fun, but unfortunately, they have no real value. Fortunately, there is now something better than imaginary internet points – Reddcoins.\nCryptocurrencies are complicated. Let’s face it – the average person has no idea how cryptocurrencies works. They would like to get involved, but usually have no idea where to start. Reddcoin's objective is to fill those voids by integrating a seamless cryptocurrency tipping system with all major social networks to make the process of exchanging coins simple, fun, and rewarding both for the giver and the receiver.\nReddcoin was conceived to be a full-fledged social network coin - the Social Currency. The developers are currently building a hub that will manage the various social media tipping accounts that will be created on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc. The plan is to make Reddcoin into a hybrid of e-currency/crypto, reward points, etc. Basically, Reddcoin will be internet points with actual monetary value. Already, tipping has been enabled on Twitter, Twitch, and Justin.TV, as well as here on Reddit.\nThe idea is to have a system that makes it easy for people and businesses to auto-tip people, re-posts, etc. Then people can use their Reddcoins on websites to purchase items or use them in games like Freemium games in place of purchasing in-game credits. This would benefit businesses, developers, and users alike. If you buy credits in-game or for a specific site, you're stuck to using them in only that place. With Reddcoins, you could potentially use them any number of places, helping ease fears over purchasing game or site credits.\nThe plan for Reddcoin is to essentially be the internet's official "like" button. Can you imagine being tipped on Instagram for your picture upload, on Facebook for your location check-in, on YouTube for a silly video you uploaded, on Reddit for your witty comment, etc.? Now imagine being able to exchange those Reddcoins instantly for physical goods or gift cards. Or even transferring all your Reddcoins to a game you love playing. You would be getting paid for things that take zero effort or that you are probably already doing for free anyway.

1041	Dragonchain	DRGN	130	238421940	433494437	\N	1530508162	2243	Dragonchain was originally developed at Disney’s Seattle office in 2015 and 2016 as the Disney Private Blockchain Platform. Over 20 use cases and applications were explored and documented publicly via the W3C community Group. The platform was later released as open source software under the Apache 2 license in October of 2016.\nDragonchain simplifies the integration of real business applications on a blockchain and provides features such as easy integration, protection of business data and operations, currency agnosticism, and multi-currency support.\nThe Dragonchain Foundation, a Non-Profit Corporation was created in January of 2017 to maintain ownership and responsibility of the open source code.\nThe Dragonchain team is now in the process of launching a commercial entity to build a serverless architecture blockchain platform. The combination of serverless and blockchain technologies is unique and tremendously valuable. The timing of the Dragonchain platform launch is highly strategic to benefit from explosive growth of cloud computing over the last few years and the emerging wave of Blockchain solutions entering proof of concept stage across enterprises.\nThe Dragonchain team will launch Dragonchain, Inc., as a commercial entity to provide an array of products and services to the community. Our vision supports areas of the market that are underserved with strong demand and projected growth in the blockchain industry ($7.7b by 2024) across an array of multi-billion dollar sectors such as Arts, Wine, Automotive, Legal, Digital Marketing, etc. These sectors and more will experience market disruption with blockchain capabilities shifting the value proposition into decentralized environments. Dragonchain platform will support these needs.\nDragonchain provides a commercial platform for application developers to rapidly and securely deploy Blockchain applications while maintaining existing language development environments (e.g. Java, Python, Node, C#, Go); a tremendous costing and speed to market advantage. The Dragonchain architecture is also designed to allow nodes to handle approval of transactions based upon five levels of network consensus to provide a spectrum of trust to data consumers; a level of security and flexibility unseen in the market by current blockchain solution providers. These design attributes position Dragonchain for exponential growth.\nIn addition, Dragonchain will provide project incubation as well as professional services with strategic partnerships to develop successful tokenization ecosystems focusing on long term value.\nA DRGN is a tokenized micro-license for interaction with Dragonchain commercial platform services which captures legal guidance regarding US Securities law.

Ardor extends Nxt for use in certain applications that require scalability and want to avoid “mining” required by some developing blockchains.\nThere are two parts to the Ardor Platform—the Ardor main chain and child chains that are the distinct blockchains created for business with use-specific features and applications.\nThe Ardor main chain is the blockchain that will secure all of the child chains and process their transactions. Some transactions will take place on the Ardor main blockchain like the exchange of the Ardor token (ARDR) from one account to another.\nThe features on the Ardor main blockchain are limited to improve performance and to reduce the blockchain bloat that occurs with the accumulated storage of information.\nArdor is 100% Proof-of-Stake so no additional processing will be needed for mining as all tokens have already been created.

214	Blocknet	BLOCK	118	5214244	5214244	\N	1530508204	707	The Blocknet empowers the passionate communities behind every coin by serving as a connector between blockchains, markets, and communities without being an intermediary. This is made possible through atomic swaps on a truly decentralized dapp platform.\nThe Blocknet Protocol is a true peer-to-peer protocol between nodes on different blockchains. This enables the transfer of data and value between blockchains and opens the door to cross-chain dapps.\nThe Blocknet community has been developing this technology since 2014. This decentralized governance system, open source code, and inter-blockchain protocol ensure that every blockchain is free to interact without centralized entities.\nBlock DX is the first dapp built on the Blocknet Protocol. Block DX is a truly decentralized exchange that enables trading freedom for connected blockchain communities. Listing on Block DX is free and does not require our permission or control.\nThe Blocknet is powered by a network of Service Nodes and Staking Nodes. Service Nodes are the computational power behind the Blocknet's capabilities and protect the order book. Staking Nodes protect the network via our Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system.

503	Maker	MKR	37	618228	1000000	\N	1530508156	1518	MKR is a token that has a volatile price because of its unique supply mechanics and role on the Maker platform. MKR is a utility token, governance token and recapitalization resource of the Maker system.\nAs a utility token, MKR is required for paying the fees accrued on CDPs that have been used to generate Dai in the Maker system. Only MKR can pay these fees, and when paid the MKR is burned, removing it from the supply. This means that if the adoption and demand for Dai and CDPs increases, there will be additional demand for MKR so users can pay the fees. It also means the supply will decrease as MKR is burned.\nAs a governance token, MKR is used by MKR holders to vote for the risk management and business logic of the Maker system. Risk management is crucial for the systems success and survival, and is done in practice by voting on specific risk parameters for each collateral asset and CDP type. The risk parameters need to be set rigorously to correspond to the risk profile of the collateral assets used by the CDPs in the system, and determine factors such as how much extra collateral is required for generating Dai with the collateral asset, or how much Dai can be backed in total by a specific collateral asset.\nThe voting process for the governance of the system is done through continuous approval voting. This means every MKR holder can vote for any number of proposals with the MKR he holds, and can submit a new proposal, or cast or withdraw his votes at any point in time. The proposal that has the most votes from all MKR holders becomes the “top proposal” and can be activated to implement changes to the risk parameters of the system. There is a security delay after the proposal is activated, before its changes are implemented, in order to give the community enough time to react and prevent malicious proposals from damaging the system.\nThe initial governance framework for Dai risk management will be using the Sunday meetings to spread awareness around new proposals, and coordinate votes. Based on the experience learned in governing Dai we will work together in the community to come up with a holistic framework for future governance of the scale that the system will need in the long run. There will be a simple dapp available that allows any MKR holder to easily vote with their MKR by using metamask, mist or parity. More advanced features are planned for the future, such as delegating your votes to a proxy voter, and the ability to safely vote with MKR held in cold storage.\nIf MKR holders are highly competent and govern the system well, CDPs will always remain overcollateralized and there will be no threat of insolvency to the system. However mistakes or unforeseen circumstances can happen, and as a result it is possible that parts of the collateral portfolio becomes undercollateralized. When this happens the last function of the MKR token is triggered: automatic recapitalization through forced MKR dilution. This means that the Maker system automatically creates new MKR tokens and sells them on the market, instantly raising money to recapitalize the shortfall of value in the system and bring it back from insolvency. This means that MKR holders are held directly accountable for their actions, since bad governance will result in their tokens becoming diluted.

Integrate to move money quickly, reliably, and at almost no cost.\nXLM is a completely decentralized consensus platform. It is designed to support any type of currency. It has a built in decentralized exchange that can be used to trade any type of currency or asset. \nA decentralized network consists of peers that can run independently of each other. \nThis means that the Stellar network does not depend on any single entity. The idea is to have as many independent servers participate in the Stellar network as possible, so that the network will still run successfully even if some servers fail.\nLike a traditional ledger, the Stellar ledger records a list of all the balances and transactions belonging to every single account on the network. A complete copy of the global Stellar ledger is hosted on each server that runs the Stellar software. Any entity can run a Stellar server.\nThese servers form a decentralized Stellar network, allowing the ledger to be distributed as widely as possible. The servers sync and validate the ledger by a mechanism known as consensus.\nThis entire process of coming to consensus on the Stellar network occurs approximately every 2-5 seconds.

131	Monero	XMR	12	16185982	16185982	\N	1530508148	328	Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency created in April 2014 that focuses on privacy and decentralization that runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and FreeBSD. Monero uses a public ledger to record transactions while new units are created through a process called mining. Monero aims to improve on existing cryptocurrency design by obscuring sender, recipient and amount of every transaction made as well as making the mining process more egalitarian.\nThe focus on privacy has attracted illicit use by people interested in evading law enforcement. The egalitarian mining process made it viable to distribute the mining effort opening new funding avenues for both legitimate online publishers and malicious hackers who covertly embed mining code into websites and apps.

The Nexus currency powers the new digital economy by providing fast, affordable, and secure payment channels that are easy to use and eliminate wasteful transaction fees. Nexus provides essential tools to embolden individuals and organizations to manage their finances with complete autonomy. Nexus is the next step in the evolution of financial freedom.\nNexus digital currency allows you to control your finances with complete freedom. Secured by Nexus’s quantum-resistant encryption, access to your funds requires a personal key that only you control, which grants access to your account from anywhere at anytime. There are no restrictions or limitations, no access charges or hidden fees, and no middlemen that can freeze or steal your funds.\nNexus digital currency is a global payment method designed with business needs in mind. There is no downtime, payments process within seconds, and payments received are spendable within 3 minutes. Most importantly there are no service fees or unexpected charges, which means you receive the full proceeds from sale.\nNexus’s blockchain-based technology is essentially an immutable distributed ledger secured across multiple servers. Every transaction ever made is recorded and stored, and can be reviewed transparently. This feature is useful as a receipt system, auditable financial record, or to enable investors or donors to track the use of their contributions.\nThe current financial system allows banks and other institutions to issue loans merely by crediting accounts on a ledger, maintaining only enough cash on hand for short-term needs. Bank deposits are similar in that they are simply a record of how much the bank owes its customers, and are not actually an asset in most cases. Nexus changes this paradigm of debt to one of prosperity by improving the cornerstone of blockchain technology: the immutable, distributed, and transparent ledger. The Nexus protocol ensures positive cash flow by preventing accounts from spending capital they do not have, and loans on the blockchain are only possible through the actual transfer of capital. The creation of new currency is capped at 3% per year, and is awarded in exchange for securing the network, rather than being issued by a central institution. Nexus is the future of value.

953	Power Ledger	POWR	81	373406643	1000000000	\N	1530508159	2132	Power Ledger (POWR) is an Australian blockchain-based cryptocurrency and energy trading platform that allows for decentralized selling and buying of renewable energy. The platform provides consumers with access to a variety of energy markets around the globe and is meant to be scalable to various energy infrastructures and regulations. The market is based on a dual-token ecosystem operating on two blockchain layers, POWR and Sparkz. POWR tokens allow consumers and hosts providing energy to interface with the ecosystem and are protected through Smart Bond technology. POWR tokens can be converted into Sparkz tokens, which can be used for frictionless transactions in the energy exchange market. The initial coin offering for POWR tokens became the largest crowd funding project in Australia and the 14th highest in the world.

As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined.

906	Request Network	REQ	145	697341633	999991397	\N	1530508159	2071	Request is a decentralized network that allows anyone to request a payment (a Request Invoice) for which the recipient can pay in a secure way. All of the information is stored in a decentralized authentic ledger. This results in cheaper, easier, and more secure payments, and it allows for a wide range of automation possibilities. Request can be seen as a layer on top of Ethereum, which allows requests for payments that satisfy a legal framework. It is also possible to see currencies as tools to complete Request transactions. In this sense, Request is more global than any currency.\nREQ tokens are ERC20 tokens which are necessary to participate in the network, create advanced Requests and reward various parties who will help build the request ecosystem. When using the network, the participants will need to pay a network fee in REQ which will be burned.

Nxt was specifically conceived as a flexible platform around which to build applications and financial services. It has an integrated Asset Exchange (comparable to shares), messaging system and marketplace. Users can also create new currencies within the system. The last major release enabled Multisignature capabilities and a plugin-system for the client.\nNxt has been covered extensively in the "Call for Evidence" report by ESMA, to which the Nxt community responded in July 2015.

1	Bitcoin	BTC	1	17126800	17126800	21000000	1530508161	1	Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system. It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator. The network is peer-to-peer and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was invented by an unknown person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009.\nBitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoin as payment. Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there are 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.

The Sia Storage Platform leverages underutilized hard drive capacity around the world to create a data storage marketplace that is more reliable and lower cost than traditional cloud storage providers.\nSia uses a new cryptocurrency, called the siacoin.\nThe most important features of Sia can only be accessed by using siacoins. All storage contracts and all Sia payment channels require owning siacoins. This requirement means that as Sia grows in usage, so too will demand for siacoins.\nAs demand grows, the price will increase. If Sia is being used for billions of dollars of storage, billions of dollars of siacoins will be required. The value of the siacoin is inextricably tied to the amount of storage in use on the Sia\nnetwork.

Vertcoin (VTC) stays true to the original vision of cryptocurrency: a financial system owned by its users, the people’s coin. Vertcoin is not controlled by large banks or mining hardware manufacturers and can be mined by anyone profitably. Fairly distributed without a premine, ICO or airdrop, Vertcoin is developed by community members working as volunteers and the project is wholly funded by donations. A finite resource similar to gold, you can rest assured that Vertcoin will keep your money safe from vested interests and ensure that transaction fees are proportionate and shared between a large number of miners. With Vertcoin, you can truly be your own bank.\nVertcoin’s algorithm is designed to resist the development of custom mining hardware and multipool mining, ensuring that transactions are validated by a widely distributed network and avoiding the selling pressure when large mining pools indiscriminately flood the market with freshly mined coins. Our developers have pledged to take whatever steps are necessary to protect this coin from specialized mining equipment and make sure that it will always be possible to mine with consumer grade hardware. This is great news for miners because it offers the opportunity for all miners to compete fairly with each other, and not have to risk falling victim to unscrupulous hardware manufacturers who may fail to deliver pre-ordered equipment.

Besides predictable increase of MNX price enables you to earn from increase in the exchange rate.\nThe main purpose of MinexBank is to stabilize the exchange rate within the range of no more than 5% of the previous day’s closure price. The five per cent growth owes to the practice of global stock exchanges. Once the values are reached, stock markets halt the trading, thus preventing speculators and misguided investors from dictating their own prices. Once the limit values of the five per cent range are reached, MinexBank has two options: it either changes interest rates for parking payouts, or intervenes to keep the price within the preset range. Coin parking and intervention are the basic financial instruments used by MinexBank.

We believe this will allow Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications to run on a familiar foundation, while offering a robust environment for developers. The underlying technology uses an “Account Abstract Layer”, which acts as a bridge between the EVM and the Unspent Transaction Output model of Bitcoin Core. There will be Oracles and Datafeed functionality, allowing developers to create Smart Contracts built around trusted sources of information.\nThe Qtum Foundation plans to be the public blockchain for business. Development efforts will allow us to market this platform to various industries, such as: Mobile Telecommunications, Counterfeit Protection, Finance, Industrial Logistics (shipping, warranty, etc), and Manufacturing.

Once the API they'd like to offer to smart contracts is connected to a ChainLink, they become a ChainLink Node Operator, responsible for keeping that API connected to the ChainLink Network and being compensated in LINK for their successful fulfillment of on-chain requests.\nThe LINK token is an EIP20 token with additional ERC667 functionality. The total supply of the token is 1,000,000,000, and each token is divisible up to 18 decimal places. To prevent accidental burns, the token does not allow transfers to the contract itself and to 0x0.

It is the first decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage that uses blockchain technology and cryptography to secure your files.\nStorj is a platform, cryptocurrency, and suite of decentralized applications that allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are encrypted, shredded into little pieces called 'shards', and stored in a decentralized network of computers around the globe. No one but you has a complete copy of your file, not even in an ecrypted form.\nBecause of this, Storj can be faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional cloud storage platforms. Faster because multiple machines are serving you your file simultaneously, cheaper because you are renting people's spare hard-drive space instead of paying for a purpose-built data center, and more secure because your file is both encrypted and shredded. There is no need to trust a corporation, vulnerable servers, or employees with your files. Storj completely removes trust from the equation.\nStorj uses blockchain features like a transaction ledger, public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions for security.\nStorj is working hard to solve data security issues with the help of its own web app, Storj, which lets you store your files, and client app, Storj Share, which lets you rent your hard-drive space for money.\nTo best protect your data, files are encrypted client-side on your computer before they are uploaded. Each file is split up into chunks which are first encrypted and then distributed for storage across the Storj network. The network is comprised of Storj Share nodes run by users around the world who rent out their unused hard drive space in return for Storj Token (STORJ).\nThe decentralized aspect of Storj means there are no central servers to be compromised, and with client-side encryption, your are in control of the keys to your files.

"Gas", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate spam and allocate resources on the network.\nEthereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Development was funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014. The system went live on 30 July 2015, with 11.9 million coins "premined" for the crowdsale. This accounts for approximately 13 percent of the total circulating supply.\nIn 2016, as a result of the collapse of The DAO project, Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains – the new separate version became Ethereum (ETH), and the original continued as Ethereum Classic (ETC). The value of the Ethereum currency grew over 13,000 percent in 2017.

Each account has its own blockchain (account-chain), equivalent to the account’s transaction/balance history. Each account-chain can only be updated by the account’s owner; this allows each account-chain to be updated immediately and asynchronously to the rest of the block-lattice, resulting in quick transactions. Since blocks can only be added by each account-chain’s owner, transferring funds from one account to another requires two transactions: a send transaction deducting the amount from the sender’s balance and a receive transaction adding the amount to the receiving account’s balance.

Zilliqa has been under research and development for two years. It brings the theory of sharding to practice with its novel protocol that increases transaction rates as its network expands.\nZilliqa processes more transactions per second as more mining nodes join the network. This may sound like a natural thing at first, but it turns out to be technically challenging to accomplish, and certainly hasn’t been possible by past blockchain protocols. Getting consensus in a larger crowd is technically harder! Zilliqa’s novel consensus protocol solves this problem. With Zilliqa’s scalability, we can support dApps that demand transaction rates beyond today’s blockchains.\nZilliqa only leverages PoW to establish mining identities. This process defends against sybil attacks and is also used to perform network sharding. Unlike other blockchains though, Zilliqa does not use PoW for consensus. PoW is performed only at larger intervals, not by every miner on every block. Thus, it has a much smaller energy footprint. We’ve stayed with PoW since it has been well studied in the literature and field-tested, while its emerging alternatives (such as PoS) are still under active research.

763	0x	ZRX	28	533240376	1000000000	\N	1530508156	1896	At its core, 0x is an open and non-rent seeking protocol that facilitates trustless, low friction exchange of Ethereum-based assets. Developers can use 0x as a platform to build exchange applications on top of (0x.js is a Javascript library for interacting with the 0x protocol). For end users, 0x will be the infrastructure of a wide variety of user-facing applications i.e. 0x Portal, a decentralized application that facilitates trustless trading of Ethereum-based tokens between known counterparties.\nIn the two years since the Ethereum blockchain’s genesis block, numerous decentralized applications (dApps) have created Ethereum smart contracts for peer-to-peer exchange. Rapid iteration and a lack of best practices have left the blockchain scattered with proprietary and application-specific implementations. As a result, end users are exposed to numerous smart contracts of varying quality and security, with unique configuration processes and learning curves, all of which implement the same functionality. This approach imposes unnecessary costs on the network by fragmenting end users according to the particular dApp each user happens to be using, eliminating valuable network effects around liquidity. 0x is the solution to this problem by acting as modular, unopinionated building blocks that may be assembled and reconfigured.\n0x protocol token (ZRX) is utilized in two ways: 1) to solve the coordination problem and drive network effects around liquidity, creating a feedback loop where early adopters of the protocol benefit from wider adoption and 2) to be used for decentralized governance over 0x protocol's update mechanism. In more detail:\nZRX tokens are used by Makers and Takers (market participants that generate and consume orders, respectively) to pay transaction fees to Relayers (entities that host and maintain public order books).\nZRX tokens are used for decentralized governance over 0x protocol’s update mechanism which allows its underlying smart contracts to be replaced and improved over time. An update mechanism is needed because 0x is built upon Ethereum’s rapidly evolving technology stack, decentralized governance is needed because 0x protocol’s smart contracts will have access to user funds and numerous dApps will need to plug into 0x smart contracts. Decentralized governance ensures that this update process is secure and minimizes disruption to the network.

BitcoinZ launched with no premine, no developer fees, no ICO, was not a chain fork of any coin - it started at Block 1. In addition to these founding principles, BitcoinZ has also committed itself to always being GPU mineable and resist ASIC miners.\nAside from its strict adherence to its founding principles, BitcoinZ prides itself in pushing the limits of decentralization by 100% community inclusion - the community posts open and public proposals for change and proposals are voting on. The community infrastructure is also community owned - no one person can revoke their contribution in a manner that degrades service to the community. Progress is achieved by complete volunteerism, with some proposals seeking a budget from community donations - mostly from member mining activities and pools supporting the project by setting their pools to auto-donate.

We are the first to innovate, develop and implement Proof of Disintegration (PoD) successfully into a blockchain, giving birth to the world's first Fundamental Nodes (FNs). \n\nPoD completely destroys coins from the blockchain when a user sends enough coins to create a FN. Reducing circulating/total supply, PoD eliminates the risk of coins re-entering the supply, a significant attribute/innovation over Proof of Burn (PoB) which traditionally accumulates coins in an external wallet, hiding coins from the supply, with the possibility of re-entering at a later date. While PoD only currently works in the creation of FNs, B3 Coin plans to implement more supply reducing features using PoD, such as micro-disintegrations on transactions. \nWith the release of a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the horizon, B3 Coin is positioned to be a unique "supply-disintegration machine". Reducing supply, rewarding FN operators and with a supportive community, our DEX will stand alone with a promising future in the cryosphere. \nB3 Coin combines the growing support of it's community, with the success of integrating PoD, and our unique "supply-disintegration machine" of a DEX to be released in the future, B3 Coin will take the lead in anti-inflationary coins.

A multi-tier blockchain system designed to address unsolved questions of scalability, privacy, and interoperability in blockchain networks.\nThe Aion blockchain network is like a computer network that makes it possible for dissimilar systems to communicate. \nThe Aion network will pass logic and value among participating blockchains as freely as liquid assets, where every transaction occurs without centralized intermediaries.\nThe Aion network will be centered on a public, purpose-built third-generation blockchain called Aion-1. Designed to connect other blockchains and manage its own robust applications, Aion-1 also provides the crypto-economic system that incentivizes interoperability in the ecosystem.\nThe AION token is initially being offered on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token. As soon as the Aion network is operational, these ERC-20 tokens can be seamlessly converted to AION network tokens, and will continue to be able to flow freely back and forth between these two blockchains.\nThe AION token is the fundamental method of interaction within the Aion network and its primary currency, powering:\nAION-1 OPERATIONS: Mechanics of the Aion-1 blockchain are powered by the AION token, including the ability for users to stake tokens to back validators of Aion’s consensus process.\nBLOCKCHAIN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS: Developing applications on Aion-1 requires the use of AION tokens to access the resources of Aion Virtual Machine. Based on the complexity of the application, the AVM consumes tokens as fuel.\nINTER-CHAIN BRIDGES: In order to instantiate a bridge from Aion-1 to any participating blockchain, AION tokens must be staked into a bridge registry contract. Once built, other nodes can join the bridge by also staking AION tokens. Fees for inter-chain transactions are set by bridges, and distributed to the validators on those bridges.\nPARTICIPATING BLOCKCHAINS: AION tokens can be used to access and create customized Aion-compatible participating blockchains.

21	Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD’s Failed Upside Attempt	Key Points\n\nBitcoin cash price moved a few points above $700, but it failed to gain momentum against the US Dollar.\nThis week’s highlighted important bearish trend line was broken with resistance at $708 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\nThe pair failed to gain traction and it could move back below $700 in the near term.\n\nBitcoin cash price failed to recover above $720 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD may perhaps resume its slide for more losses below $700.\nBitcoin Cash Price Support\nYesterday, there was a minor upside move initiated from the $688 swing low in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The BCH/USD pair tested the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $664 low to $780 high. Later, it started an upside move and traded above the $700 level. More importantly, this week’s highlighted important bearish trend line was broken with resistance at $708 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nHowever, the price failed to gain momentum after it broke the trend line and $700. It also faced a strong resistance near the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $780 high to $688 low. Lastly, the 100 hourly simple moving average and the $720 resistance also stopped gains. The price is once again under pressure and it may perhaps break the $700 level. On the downside, supports are seen near the $688 and $665 levels.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price has to move above the $720 resistance and the 100 hourly SMA. The 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $780 high to $688 low is also at $734 to prevent gains. A successful close above $735-740 is needed for buyers to take control.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slightly in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is now placed above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $688\nMajor Resistance Level – $735\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD’s Failed Upside Attempt appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/bitcoin-cash-price-analysis-bch-usds-failed-upside-attempt/	2018-06-28 04:08:22+00	17
22	Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH/USD’s Bearish Trend Intact	Key Highlights\n\nETH price corrected a few points higher towards the $448-450 resistance against the US Dollar.\nYesterday’s highlighted key bearish trend line is in place with resistance near $452 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\nThe pair struggled to move above $450 and the 100 hourly simple moving average, which is a bearish sign.\n\nEthereum price remains in a bearish zone against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ETH/USD could continue to move down as long as it is below $450.\nEthereum Price Upside Hurdle\nYesterday, ETH price moved further lower and traded close to the $420 level against the US Dollar. The ETH/USD pair formed a low at $419.96 before starting an upside correction. It moved higher and broke the $430 resistance. There was also a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $473 high to $419 low. However, the upside move was capped by the $450 level.\nIt seems like the price failed to move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $473 high to $419 low. More importantly, the 100 hourly simple moving average protected gains near the $450 level. On the upside, yesterday’s highlighted key bearish trend line is in place with resistance near $452 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair clearly failed to gain momentum above the $450 level and is currently moving lower. An initial support is around the $430 level, below which, the price may revisit the recent low near $419.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price remains at a risk of more losses below $430. To initiate a decent recovery, the price must clear the $450 resistance, 100 hourly SMA, and the trend line. Above $452, the next major hurdle for buyers is near the $470 level.\nHourly MACD – The MACD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI – The RSI is currently moving lower towards the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $420\nMajor Resistance Level – $452\nThe post Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH/USD’s Bearish Trend Intact appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-usds-bearish-trend-intact/	2018-06-28 05:00:52+00	11

23	US Agencies Seize Cryptocurrencies from Dark Web Vendors Valued Over $23 Million	Cryptocurrencies have historically been used as a way to transfer value between shrouded individuals, with the infamous ‘Silk Road’ dark web marketplace being a key example. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has just announced the arrests of over 35 dark web vendors, seizing cryptocurrency holdings from the arrested individuals. \nCryptocurrencies Taken from Dark Web Illicit Good Vendors\nYesterday, the U.S. DOJ released a statement, drawing attention to the conclusion of a year-long operation specifically targeting dark web vendors. \nAccording to the release, the DOJ, along with other American governmental agencies, like the U.S. Secret Service and the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit, investigated 65 targets. The 65 investigations led to the arrest of more than 35 individuals involved in illicit dealings. \nEnforcement officers disguised themselves as money launderers, building trust between the officers and dark web dealers, which are often put at a distance. As a result, the HSI agents utilizing this stratagem personally identified a multitude of vendors, creating a logical path to the over 35 arrests made. \nDeputy Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein addressed the case, adamantly declaring:\n“Criminals who think that they are safe on the darknet are wrong. We can expose their networks, and we are determined to bring them to justice.”\nAlong with the 35 arrests, law enforcement agents also seized a variety of assets from the indicted criminals. \nRosenstein, the aforementioned law enforcement agency, gave credence to the success of the operation, saying: \n“We seized their weapons, their drugs, and $23.6 million of their ill-gotten gains. This nationwide enforcement effort will reduce the supply of deadly drugs like fentanyl that are killing an unprecedented number of Americans.”\nThe seized assets, valued at over $23 million, included copious amounts of narcotics, 100 firearms, five vehicles, gold bars and U.S. dollars, and most importantly, a multitude of cryptocurrencies and mining machines that are collectively worth over $20 million.  \nBitcoin, But No Privacy Cryptocurrencies? \nThe release was not fully transparent about the exact specifics regarding the cryptocurrency holdings. However, it was noted that over 2,000 Bitcoins were seized, coming to a value of $12 million at today’s prices. It was also disclosed that the government is still seeking the forfeiture of an additional 4,000 Bitcoin from two criminals hailing from Maryland. \nSome found it odd that vendors on the dark web would use Bitcoin at all. Tech-savvy individuals have made it clear that it is possible to discern the identity of the people behind certain Bitcoin transactions. This factor has only added to the growing appeal for privacy-based cryptocurrencies, like Monero or Zcash, which allow for the introduction of higher levels of financial privacy. Despite the recent listing of Zcash on the U.S-based Gemini exchange, privacy coins have become a target for governmental regulation. \nThe Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA), recently introduced restrictions on exchanges operating in Japan, outright banning the offering of privacy coin trading. The FSA suggested that these cryptocurrencies introduce a high risk of money laundering and the funding of illegal activities, evidently something a government-run agency would want to crack down on. \nGovernmental worry regarding privacy coins has grown rapidly, with the U.S. government also indicating a growing worry for this rapidly expanding sub-industry. But users, even those who aren’t criminals, will continue to move to privacy cryptocurrencies, as they seek the financial privacy that traditional cash offers.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post US Agencies Seize Cryptocurrencies from Dark Web Vendors Valued Over $23 Million appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/us-agencies-seize-cryptocurrencies-from-dark-web-vendors-valued-over-23-million/	2018-06-27 21:15:12+00	14

77	Silicon Valley Giant Andreessen Horowitz Launches $300 Million “all weather” Crypto Fund	One of Silicon Valley’s biggest tech and investment firms, Andreessen Horowitz, has announced the creation of a crypto investment fund worth $300 million. The firm has described this as an “all weather” fund which will continue to invest, no matter what the market is doing.\nThe company’s announcement should be greeted with enthusiasm by the crypto-community which has seen prices consistently falling over the last few weeks. The price of bitcoin is hovering around the six-thousand-dollar mark at the moment, a spectacular tumble since the dizzy heights of $19k in December.\nAndreessen Horowitz, or “A16Z” as it is known, has a history of bullishness regarding crypto. It has made numerous strategic investments over the years in huge companies including Coinbase and Facebook. General Partner and board member Balaji Srinivasan is running Earn.com, which is now a Coinbase portfolio company.\nIn this latest round of crypto-bullishness, the company, in addition to creating this $300 million fund, has hired a new General Partner, Katie Haun. As well as being the firm’s first ever female GP, she boasts impressive credentials; she is a former federal prosecutor who had a significant hand in leading the case against dark-net marketplace Silk Road, as well as controversy-soaked exchange BTC-e.\nExplaining why the company was creating the fund, A16Z highlighted the novelty of trust as a primitive that blockchain exploits. This leads to a unique relationship between developers, users and the platform, a relationship which can be applied to a broad range of use-cases across many fields. In explaining what they believe the importance of the development path is, the firm stated:\n“In an era in which the internet is increasingly controlled by a handful of large tech incumbents, it’s more important than ever to create the right economic conditions for developers, creators, and entrepreneurs.”\nThe fund’s long-term focus makes its investment an “all weather” fund, according to the company. It will be investing in projects both at the genesis phase of development, to those which are already off the ground – so-called non-speculative investments. The crypto-winter which has set in since January has not tempered the bullish outlook at the company and so investment by the fund will continue whatever the weather in the market.\n“We have an “all weather” fund. We plan to invest consistently over time, regardless of market conditions. If there is another crypto winter, we’ll keep investing aggressively.”\nThe firm’s announcement raises hopes for an end to the bear market which has endured for the first half of the year. It also highlights that the firm sees development of use-cases as critical to development of the crypto-ecosystem. As reported in ToshiTimes yesterday, Ben Davenport of BitGo theorized that the value of use cases was rather negligible compared to the value of HODLing; A16Z’s investment into the space clearly shows the contrary: a belief in the value of use cases.\n“We want services powered by crypto protocols to be used by hundreds of millions and eventually billions of people. Crypto tokens are the native asset class of digital networks, but their value is driven by the underlying, practical uses cases.”\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Silicon Valley Giant Andreessen Horowitz Launches $300 Million “all weather” Crypto Fund appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/silicon-valley-giant-andreessen-horowitz-launches-300-million-all-weather-crypto-fund/	2018-06-27 15:32:03+00	5
78	The Founder of EOS Proposes a New Constitution. The Current One is Overly Broad.	Dan Larimer, CTO at Block.one and inventor of EOS network, proposed the removal of the current version of the EOS constitution. Larimer wrote a Medium post where he reviews the current issues with governance of the newly-launched blockchain. In conclusion he proposes an updated draft of the constitution where the terms that could not be enforced by code were removed. Furthermore, more power has been delegated to the block producers, who conceivably will be in charge of solving disputes of intent in code. “Producers are in charge because that is reality”  — noted the EOS founder in a conversation held in the EOSGov Telegram channel. \nThe rework of the EOS constitution proposed by Dan Larimer focuses on maximizing the principle of Code-is-Law. Larimer reflects on the disputes arisen after the recent community-driven launch of the own blockchain and governance system.\n“From watching the community launch an EOS.IO based blockchain, Block.one has learned a lot already. We have seen that if you give people arbitrary power to resolve arbitrary disputes then everything becomes a dispute and the decisions made are arbitrary.”\nIn the new constitution Larimer aspires to have all contractual terms to be laid out by code yet transparent through documenting the intent of the code into the smart Ricardian contract blockchain. Dan dictates the official position of Block.one and calls for ‘an end of arbitration orders other than non-binding opinions on the intent of the code’. The block.one CTO proposes the arbitration power to be delegated to a super majority of the jury of block producers, namely 2/3+1 of the votes. This power, according to Larimer, needs to be exercised only for fixing the issues stemming from differences between code and intent, such as code vulnerabilities and contract bugs that may lead to major hacks of the network (e.g. the DAO hack on the Ethereum).\nThe governance model has become the subject of a large controversy in the past weeks following the launch of the EOS network. The block producers froze funds a number of accounts that were identified to be a subject to phishing scam. In the first instance, the measures were taken in violation of the EOS constitution and the required order from the arbitration body, ECAF, came retrospectively. In the second instance, the block producers obeyed the order issued by ECAF and froze 27 more fraudulent accounts. The statement contained no explanation for the specified measures. The aforementioned incidents raised the concerns of the community over the level of transparency and coming from the Arbitration Forum, as well as the general implications on the decentralization of the system. \nLarimer also suggests block producers to donate a part of their profits to the people who fell victims to the scam that provided users fake public/private keys. EOS inventor claims that interventions on-chain would do more damage to the EOS ecosystem. The inventor of the said ecosystem seeks alternatives to the central arbitration system. Larimer suggests a model, where users would be able to opt an organization of choice to arbitrate disputes over stolen keys. \nAccording to the current EOS constitution, the amending its content will require a vote of no less than 15% vote participation among tokens and no fewer than 10% more Yes than No votes, sustained for 30 continuous days within a 120 day period. The short yet vivid history of voting on EOS blockchain has shown that it may be challenging for Dan Larimer to achieve a majority on a potential referendum for a permanent draft of the constitution. It took EOS two weeks to get 15% of the votes for their Block Producers. The new vote would need the majority to remain unbroken for a month. \nSam Sapoznick, the person who signed the last order in the capacity of ECAF Interim Emergency Arbitrator has spoken out on the proposal in the EOSGov Telegram channel. \n“Dan’s proposal will (and ought to be) carefully analyzed, questioned, and if needed, revised, like any other community-sourced proposal would be. Dan’s follow-up post, delivered very timely, operates at a deeper level than the current community emotional response against ECAF and I think moves the overall governance discourse forward in a productive fashion.”\nImage SourcE: “Flickr”\nThe post The Founder of EOS Proposes a New Constitution.

The results have just been published and they are encouraging – the interest in the budding industry is expected to double further down the road.\nDespite bitcoin and other digital currencies going through a torrid time and hovering around or below their yearly lows, the study gives us hope that a period of recovery and sustained growth might be just around the corner. \nThe study was conducted by questioning respondents in 13 European countries – Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom as well as Australia and the United States. Approximately a 1000 respondents have been surveyed in each country.\nAccording to the official report, “Sixty-six percent of people in Europe say they have heard of cryptocurrency. Fewer than one in 10 (9%) own it. An additional 16 percent say they expect to own it in future, which suggests uptake could more than double. Considering a third of those in Europe (34%) have not yet heard of cryptocurrency the growth potential could be even higher.“\nPerhaps a bit surprisingly, Turkey is the most crypto-savvy nation in Europe, with 18 percent of surveyed Turks owning virtual currencies and a further 45 percent expecting to acquire some in the future.\nEuropeans seem to favour cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, instead of considering them to be just an investment opportunity. Over one-third of respondents believe that digital currencies are the future of online spending and 30% of those polled in Europe would consider using crypto to pay for goods online. Notably, 15 percent of Europeans would even consider getting paid in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\nThe study has also revealed that the majority of respondents consider virtual currencies to be a riskier investment than real estate, bonds or stocks, which is totally understandable, having a recent crypto slump in mind. In addition, when considering a crypto investment, people tend to trust financial advisors and specialist websites instead of their friends and family.\nJessica Exton, a behavioral scientist concluded by saying that, “Cryptocurrency remains an abstract investment for many, but there may be more appetite for digital currencies than some might suggest. Based on our survey, ownership of cryptocurrencies could more than double in the future – although we do not know when.“\nImage Source: “Flickr”\n \nThe post Investments in Cryptocurrencies Expected to Double, According to ING Bank Survey appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/investments-in-cryptocurrencies-expected-to-double-according-to-ing-bank-survey/	2018-06-27 11:30:53+00	16
27	This Is How Coinbase’s CEO Aims to End Poverty with GiveCrypto Charity	The CEO of a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange is launching a charity to help people in poverty, and is aiming to raise $1 billion in the next two years.\nUsing Crypto to Raise Funds\nGiveCrypto is a new nonprofit charity that distributes cryptocurrency to people in poverty. Launched today and founded by Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, the aim is to financially empower people who need it the most around the world. Cryptocurrencies that the charity accepts include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Zcash.\nInterestingly, while two billion people have a smartphone, over 1.7 billion adults worldwide don’t have access to basic financial services, according to the World Bank’s Global Financial Inclusion Database.\nFinancial services is something that many of us take for granted, and back in January, Armstrong wrote a blog on how he thought charitable giving could work in the crypto world. At the time, he said that most charities don’t accept digital currency, and those that do often sell crypto donations into fiat to be used straight away. Yet, he believes that due to the wealth cryptocurrency has produced there is a rare opportunity to create a nonprofit fund.\nFast-forward six months and we have the birth of GiveCrypto. By giving donations in cryptocurrency the charity can distribute payments to people all around the world. All that’s needed is a mobile device with an Internet connection. The charity is aspiring to raise $10 million by the end of this year, and $1 billion in the next two years. Armstrong notes that he’s personally donated $1 million to the project.\n“I’m passionate about unlocking the potential in cryptocurrency,” he wrote in a blog today. “When I first read the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper for bitcoin, I realized it represented an opportunity to bring economic freedom to people all over the world.”\nDirect Cash Transfers\nUnlike traditional charities, which use large resources to cover overheads, Armstrong points to research that suggests direct cash transfers are an effective way of giving and ending poverty. Additionally, when distributing aid to foreign countries, high fees and corruption are unfortunate occurrences he states. Cryptocurrency, however, is a way of solving these problems.\nAccording to Armstrong, there are three things likely to happen once a person receives a donation: they will either cashout to their local currency to buy what they need; hodl their coins to reap future benefits; or undertake crypto-to-crypto transfers to initiate local crypto economies.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post This Is How Coinbase’s CEO Aims to End Poverty with GiveCrypto Charity appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/this-is-how-coinbases-ceo-aims-to-end-poverty-with-givecrypto-charity/	2018-06-27 20:10:05+00	19

24	Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Potential Reversal Formation?	Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price could be forming a short-term inverse head and shoulders pattern.\nPrice has been moving sideways for the past few days as bulls try to keep it afloat.\nTechnical indicators, however, seem to be favoring further declines in bitcoin price.\n\nBitcoin price seems to be fighting to stay afloat, but technical indicators suggest that further losses are in the cards.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA on the 1-hour chart to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse.\nIn addition, the 100 SMA is holding as dynamic resistance at the moment. Then again, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to reflect slowing bearish momentum. A rally towards the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point and beyond it could be followed by a bullish crossover.\nRSI is heading lower, though, so sellers still have the upper hand. Similarly stochastic is moving down without even hitting overbought levels, which also indicates that bears are eager to return.\nStill, a break past the potential inverse head and shoulders neckline around $6,400 could be followed by a rally of around $600 or the same height as the chart formation. If resistance continues to hold, bitcoin price could revisit the lows around $5,800.\nBTC/USD Chart from TradingView\nCoinMarketCap is reporting an increase in bitcoin interest under their Dominance Index, signaling that investors are revisiting cryptocurrencies as potential higher-yielding holdings. After all, trade troubles are weighing on global stock markets and commodities, so demand for riskier assets may be routed to digital currencies like bitcoin instead.\nThis phenomenon was observed in a few instances over the past years, such as the resurgence of Greece’s debt troubles that weighed heavily on European markets. This also drove traders to bet on alternative markets outside of traditional ones that are more vulnerable to geopolitical risk.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Potential Reversal Formation? appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/bitcoin-btc-price-watch-potential-reversal-formation/	2018-06-28 04:03:20+00	14

82	Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads	Facebook’s ban on cryptocurrency advertisements at the end of January 2018 took the crypto world a few steps back. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts will be smiling widely today as Facebook has realized the importance of the technology and reversed the ban after six months.\nThe blog post on Facebook’s official Business website written by Rob Leathern, Facebook’s Product manager, read- \n“In the last few months, we’ve looked at the best way to refine this policy — to allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe. So starting June 26, we’ll be updating our policy to allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”\nIt is clear that advertisements from pre-approved cryptocurrency businesses will be allowed which will enhance the trust between investors and these companies.\nHowever, due to history Initial Coin Offerings (ICO’s) and Binary Options will still be prohibited from Facebook advertising. \nIn the new guidelines, an application needs to be filled by the business with appropriate details such as licenses, public stock exchange information and public background documents if possible.\nThe blog post also highlighted the future of cryptocurrency advertisements on the popular social media website-\n“Given these restrictions, not everyone who wants to advertise will be able to do so. But we’ll listen to feedback, look at how well this policy works and continue to study this technology so that, if necessary, we can revise it over time.”\nThe reason for Facebook’s reversal is still not clear. There are signs of Facebook implementing Blockchain technology with news in April about David Marcus, former Facebook messenger executive leading a Blockchain team for Facebook.\nAnother reason may be the lost opportunities and revenue from advertisements generated from the highly sought after blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/facebook-reverses-ban-on-cryptocurrency-ads/	2018-06-27 07:54:55+00	6
25	The Swiss Alps Holds the Key to Storing Crypto Assets for Investors	Swiss Alps: A military-grade bunker has opened its vaults to permit wealthy cryptocurrency investors to securely store their coins. Think of the operation as a sort-of Swiss bank account for digital assets. \nSwiss Crypto Vault\nBecause the Swiss Crypto Vault doesn’t mix client’s digital assets with the company’s own, it doesn’t need a banking license to operate. This has permitted the Vault to position itself as a quasi-private bank for coins when most traditional banks refuse to hold them. The Vault also services a growing need from high net worth individuals (HNWIs), hedge funds, and the like, to securely store large amounts of cryptocurrencies which are often targeted by hackers. \nSafety and security for crypto asset holders is paramount. Not only have there been hacks and thefts of online exchanges and wallets, there have even been instances where criminals have forced themselves into peoples homes and demanded the private keys necessary to access the homeowners crypto funds. \nThe Vault, and alternatives like rival Xapo — which also operates out of a similar decommissioned military bunker — come as a growing number of HNWIs and institutions are investing in blockchain-based startups via initial coin offerings (ICOs).\nICOs, where startups generate public funds by offering tokens that can be used to operate new technologies or simply to trade for potential profits, are a massive growth sector for the cryptocurrency industry. The crowdfunding method raised some $6.3 billion in the first three months of this year, easily surpassing the total accumulated for the whole of 2017. According to experts, more than 80% of these funds are being generated by HNWIs and professional investors.\nSwitzerland’s Perfect Storm\nSwitzerland’s reputation for being a crypto-friendly destination as well as a place with growing blockchain expertise led Swiss Crypto Vault to bury its ‘banking grade’ servers in a secret location in the Alps. To access their funds, clients utilize a special web portal that permits them to withdraw coins from anywhere in the world.\n\nAs is often the case with these vaults, an extra layer of security requires the client, Swiss Crypto Vault, and also a third-party handling partner to simultaneously verify withdrawals. This is somewhat similar to the system of multiple key holders being needed to open a safe deposit box in a bank vault.\nSwiss Crypto Vault is a joint venture between Zug-based crypto financial services firm Bitcoin Suisse and Swiss Gold Safe, a company that stores precious metals, art, and other valuables in Alpine vaults. Currently, clients can store Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Litecoin, Ethereum, and all ERC20/233 tokens. The Vault plans to add more options in the future.\nDespite the fact that Swiss Crypto Vault considers its setup unique, other companies are utilizing similar technologies to safeguard cryptocurrencies too. Zug-based Crypto Storage is one, and also the state-controlled telecoms provider Swisscom. The newly-formed Swisscom Blockchain division has teamed up with hardware and software manufacturers to provide a secure storage service for big investors.\n\n“People are now investing millions into tokens,” CEO of Swisscom Blockchain division Daniel Haudenschild, said, according to Swissinfo. “As soon as you get to such volumes, the usual methods of storing these assets are no longer viable.”\n“We have a window of a few years before large providers start offering crypto vault services on an industrial scale. Until the big players also start making this service available, this will be a premium business line for those financial institutions that are willing to offer it to their clients.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post The Swiss Alps Holds the Key to Storing Crypto Assets for Investors appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/the-swiss-alps-holds-the-key-to-storing-crypto-assets-for-investors/	2018-06-27 19:01:29+00	12

143	Sacramento Kings Become First Sports Team to Mine Crypto	Ever ready to embrace technology, the Sacramento Kings announced yesterday that they are launching an initiative called MiningForGood to mine for Ethereum. The team will work with MiningStore.com to install the necessary hardware at their high tech arena – the Golden 1 Center.\nKings Mining Program to Benefit Local Community Projects\nWith their mining initiative, the Sacramento Kings are creating the basis for a multi-year scholarship program. The aim is to support various Sacramento-based community projects. According to a press release published yesterday, the basketball team will be partnered by the Build. Black. Coalition. whose focus is providing opportunities for the city’s black communities.\nThe Kings’s owner and chairman Vivek Ranadivé commented on the plans:\n“Through MiningForGood, not only will we raise funds to help with workforce development and training, we aim to inspire the next generation of tinkerers and thinkers to create change in their own community and around the globe.”\nThe press release goes on to talk about how the Sacramento mining project could become a model used by other companies and sports franchises looking to use cryptocurrency for various charitable means.\nCryptocurrency mining specialists at MiningStore.com have been drafted in to provide the necessary hardware to turn part of the team’s arena into a dedicated cryptocurrency mining centre. The miner selected for the task is MiningStore’s ‘Imperium’ model. Using these, the Kings plan to mine on the Ethereum network.\nFor those who follow the Kings away from the court, the MiningForGood program should come as little surprise. The team have long been keen to explore how technology can help build a brighter future. For starters, their arena – the Golden 1 Center – is one of the most technologically advanced in the world, being as it is entirely powered by solar energy.\nAdditionally, the team’s catering is all provided with a strong focus on minimising their environmental footprint. In addition, the Kings have already embraced cryptocurrency by becoming the first team to allow tickets to their games to be paid for with Bitcoin. They have even provided virtual reality court-side seats for students in India.\nSuch programs have led to the team being named the ‘most innovative company in sports.’ MiningStore founder John Paul Baric spoke of the Kings’s commitment to innovation as well as the new partnership:\n“The Sacramento Kings are pioneers in exploring cryptocurrency and its potential impact.. We’re thrilled to partner with a forward-thinking organization that looks for ways to create positive change – through technology or sports.”\nThe move by the Sacramento Kings will not only make them the first basketball team to mine cryptocurrency, it will make them the first professional club from any sport to launch such an initiative. However, this is hardly the first time that cryptocurrency mining has been used for charitable causes.\nIn April, NewsBTC reported on a UNICEF Australia initiative called The Hopepage. The idea behind The Hopepage is for visitors to dedicate some of their computational resources to mining Monero whilst they browse the internet.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Sacramento Kings Become First Sports Team to Mine Crypto appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/sacramento-kings-become-first-sports-team-to-mine-crypto/	2018-06-28 18:00:51+00	0

81	A New Crypto Exchange Model is Sparking Controversy and Shaking up the Industry	Two relative newcomers have hit the top cryptocurrency exchange rankings in terms of daily volume, overtaking such industry stalwarts as OKEx, Binance and Bitfinex. Overtaking is putting it mildly, as the Singapore-based CoinBene clocked over $2.1 billion, more than doubling the 24 hour volume of OKEx, which barely eclipsed the $1 billion mark. Another new player, the Hong Kong-based Bit-Z comfortably sits in the second spot, with 24 hour trading volume well over $1.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\nThe reason behind such a surprise emergence is pretty simple – a new business model that is different from all other traditional crypto exchanges. The so-called “trans-fee mining” sees exchanges adopting what you could call a more user-friendly approach and moving beyond traditional fee-taking model. In the trans-fee model crypto exchanges issue their own tokens as a way to encourage customers to trade on the platform.\nIn the case of Bit-Z, the exchange plans to release 300 million of its own BZ tokens. The clients, trading on Bit-Z will still have to pay transaction fees in bitcoin or ethereum, however the fee will be fully reimbursed to a customer in BZ tokens once the transaction is complete.\nThe companies have only launched their services in the last few days but the public interest proved to be overwhelming, as the trading volumes in the new exchanges soared beyond expectation. Nonetheless, the new model has already faced criticism, particularly from established players within the crypto exchange market.\nZhao Changpeng, CEO of Binance, likened the trans-fee model to an ICO, posting on Weibo that, “You pay transaction fees to the platform with BTC and ETH. Then the platform pays ‘100%’ back to you with its token. Isn’t it just buying platform token with BTC and ETH? How is this different from an ICO?”\nHe also went on to predict possible manipulation that the new model supposedly enables, claiming that, “If an exchange doesn’t get revenue from transaction fees and solely profits from the price of its token. How would it survive without manipulating the token price? Are you sure you want to play against a price manipulator? The same price manipulator who controls the trading platform?“\nMr. Changpeng was referring to FCoin, a Chinese exchange, using a trans-fee model. While prominent sources, such as CoinMarketCap are not tracking its data yet, Chinese media outlets suggest its 24-hour trading volume could be a staggering $5.6 billion. The company operates its own FT Token that is capped at 10 billion. 49 percent of the supply is held for the exchange and its investors, while the remaining 51 percent is distributed to the public.\nAnother controversy associated with the budding model is that it could encourage users to create fake transactions just to obtain the exchange tokens. Questions about sustaining the model in long-term have also been raised. Nonetheless, there is a new player making waves in the market and the old guard is definitely keeping their eyes open.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post A New Crypto Exchange Model is Sparking Controversy and Shaking up the Industry appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/a-new-crypto-exchange-model-is-sparking-controversy-and-shaking-up-the-industry/	2018-06-26 16:40:23+00	21
26	“Tron-Pornhub Partnership Might Repel Corporate Involvement Hurting TRX Prices”: IOTA, EOS, Stellar Lumens, Tron and Litecoin Technical Analysis	There have been wonderful news in the last two days. Facebook is reversing their cryptocurrency ad ban five months after issuing a directive while Tron is now on their mainnet after successfully completing their ERC 20-mainnet coin swap. Besides, there is VW formation of NAV seeking to bring standardization in the AV systems. All these should be positive and perhaps that is why prices are a little bit stable as they test key support lines.\nLet’s have a look at these charts:\nEOS Technical Analysis\nEOS Daily Chart by Trading View\nTwo weeks after launch and EOS is chocking with centralization accusations and human involvement in governance in a sphere that is supposed to run on autopilot. That everything should be dry and coin holders are solely responsible for their own coins’ private keys.\nOf course, we may argue that change is after all good but what with all these internal wrangles and law suit threats when orders from the ECAF fails to be implemented? What with the constitution that gives too much power to but a few validators all in the name of throughput and scalability? If this was the case, many strongly believe that Block One should have reconsidered setting up a blockchain based company and instead go for a centralized app. This will allow them to suspend accounts even on trivial matters negating the very core of blockchain which is decentralization, transparency and responsibility.\n\nWhat a surprise that just 2 weeks after launching, #EOS is considering scrapping its entire “constitution” and starting over. (Source: https://t.co/z5abgMhyPP) pic.twitter.com/cYoH7w93zL\n— Jackson Palmer (@ummjackson) June 27, 2018\n\nJudging from price action, it has been a bad month for EOS. As a matter of fact, at current spot prices, EOS is down more than 60 percent from their ATHs. It could get worse because as it stands and especially after June 26 slide, $4 is most likely the next target meaning yesterday’s trade plan is valid. The only time our stand would change is when we see movement above $9. Notwithstanding, note that at current prices, there is more impetus for potential reversals because $7 is our intermittent support line.\nLitecoin (LTC) Technical Analysis\nLitecoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nIn a new twist and obvious reconsideration, Facebook being a for-profit company is reversing their cryptocurrency ban. This comes five months after barring legitimate companies from advertising their services/products at their platform.\n\nBREAKING: Facebook is reversing its ban on #crypto-related ads.\nIn and of itself this isn't a huge deal, but I'm hopeful it will send a signal to others that crypto is here to stay. Blockchain tech, tokenization &amp; cryptocurrency will touch every aspect of our lives.#BULLISH\n— Chris Koerner | ICO Advisor | Altcoin Expert (@noBScrypto) June 26, 2018\n\nIn a blog post, their product manager said that even though their initial policy was “intentional broad” to detect fraud as much as possible, they are now allowing approved crypto companies to advertise their coin. However, not everyone have a free pass.  Facebook are categorical stating that those who intends to should first fill a form for credibility. In it they should providence license evidence and state whether they are tradable at any public crypto exchange for permission.\nDespite the slowdown in price erosion, our previous trade plan holds true. This is so because LTC prices are still trading below the lower level of resistance at $90. Now to sync with our previous forecasts, as long as bears retain LTC valuation below this buy trigger line, we should be comfortable selling with targets at $70. It is the first support line. Should there be further sells, then $50 would be another target for sellers. All this time, safe stops would be at June 26 highs at $85. Obviously, any push above $90 cancels this short to medium term short evaluation.\nStellar Lumens (XLM) Technical Analysis\nStellar Lumens Daily Chart by Trading View\nBased on technical formations and the reluctance of buyers to push prices above 20 cents, our previous trade plans remains valid. It’s a simplistic approach. Thanks to recent tight trading, our decisions are all subject to buy pressure reversing losses and printing XLM prices above 20 cents. This is a minor but immediate resistance line. Therefore, as long as XLM prices struggles below June 26 prices, selling at lower time frames with targets at 15 cents and 8 cents as before is but valid.\nTron (TRX) Technical Analysis\nTron Daily Chart by Trading View\nNow, while there are no official announcements from Tron about their partnership with Pornhub partnership. In all honesty, it’s negative if at all Tron is going to attract big money. Porn is acceptable in the internet-that’s a fact but many big investment funds label Pornhub business plan “immoral”. The prospect of Tron partnering with a porn vendor is unacceptable to them.\n\nPornhub and TRON (TRX): The Future Has Come…Again. @tronfoundation accepted soon on Premium pic.twitter.com/EzGRjSsJTH\n— Pornhub ARIA (@Pornhub) June 27, 2018\n\nAt a glance, statistics shows that TRX is down five percent in the last 24 hours and below the main support line at 4 cents. Now, in line with our previous trade plan(s), my recommendation is simple: Sell and trade with the trend. Safe stops should be at June 26 highs at 4.3 cents while targets remains unchanged at Q1 2018 lows.\nIOTA (IOT) Technical Analysis\nIOTA Daily Chart by Trading View\nThere are many practical user case applications of IOTA. And thanks to the many partnerships in the first half of 2018, there is enough evidence for that.\n\n#Volkswagen &amp; #Audi Employees Being Coached on #IOTA (#MIOTA). For #carProducer the #tangle's #DataMarketplace is perfect standard protocol enabeling #OTA-updates, #m2m payments, #SmartCharging in #SmartCities &amp; other #AI-Apps w/in #cars. @iotatokennews https://t.co/wvpxRym8Hk\n— Stefan Hein (@stuard_mace) June 27, 2018\n\nThere are even better news because VW, the giant automaker keen on making technological strides in the autonomous vehicles leveraging on the Tangle teamed up with four suppliers including Bosch forming the Networking for Autonomous Vehicles (NAV). These are all positive to Tangle but unfortunately, we need to see that translating and supporting price.\nIn the last 24 hours for example, IOTA prices are down three percent finding temporary support at 90 cents though trading below the psychological $1 mark. Because of this and the general low volatility, we retain our bearish stand waiting for: breakouts below 90 cents endorsing our initial trade plan with targets at 70 cents or supports with rejection of lower lows pushing prices above $1.18 canceling this bearish projection.

79	Visa Cryptocurrency Would Only be Worth $3 Billion?	The founder and CEO of BitGo, Ben Davenport used some basic calculations to arrive at the conclusion that the value of payment utility in crypto may be worth just three billion dollars, after responding to comments made by CEO of Civic, Vinny Lingham on twitter.\n\nThe reason I believe that crypto has to have real utility &amp; usage to support the price, is because when all the speculation ends, that ensures there is a baseline of demand – be it Bitcoin or any other crypto. I hope my views are understood to be pragmatic, and not negative.\n— Vinny Lingham (@VinnyLingham) June 24, 2018\n\nLingham’s post which attracted Davenport’s comments, argued that utility value of a cryptocurrency is critical as it ensures a baseline level of demand, once speculative demand disappears.\nDavenport however, said that this value created purely by utility was actually so small as to be negligible in the portion of the overall value of a currency. Over a number of consecutive tweets, Davenport laid out his mathematical reasoning.\nIn a hypothetical scenario, Davenport theorized about what would happen if payments giant Visa launched its own cryptocurrency, whose utility was that it could settle transactions and convert them into local currencies within 1 hour. Visa currently handles over $9 trillion in transactions every year and has a market cap of $294 billion.\nDavenport’s reasoning followed that at the end of dividing this all down (through the quick maths of 9 trillion / 365 days / 24 hours *3 to account for holidays and increased shopping periods) the base line value created by utility, as Lingham had put it, was left at a meagre $3 billion.\nThrough this reasoning, Davenport added:\n“A HODLer choosing to hold a coin for even a month is 720 times as effective at generating base demand as the payments use case in your example…”\nThis is obviously very quick maths designed to illustrate a point. Davenport even admits that people would certainly hold on to a Visa-issued crypto for longer durations, but his argument nevertheless raises poignant questions. Most proponents of the technology advocate that developing use cases is the way to secure the future of crypto, however with such possibly limited base-level value created by the utility provided by one of the largest payments solutions providers on the planet, we may be left scratching our heads.\nHowever, we should bear in mind a couple of points: firstly, utility and speculative demand can never be truly separated and in fact, utility drives speculative demand to a significant degree. This is called hype, and it can be seen with price spikes around announcements of payments solutions like Litepay and Bitpay. \nFurthermore, this theory fails to show how utility will still increase crypto value: HODLers will always be present in a market for a deflationary asset – aka, one with a limited supply, like bitcoin or indeed gold – the idea is buying it now, will mean selling it for more later. Utility will increase demand for that deflationary asset by both the firms utilising it, and HODLers, who will pile in. When all is said and done this will translate into much more demand chasing a much more limited supply of this asset around the market. And at the end of the day, that means zeros.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\n \nThe post Visa Cryptocurrency Would Only be Worth $3 Billion? appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/visa-cryptocurrency-would-only-be-worth-3-billion/	2018-06-27 05:48:17+00	7
28	BitPico Ready to Launch a 51% Attack on Bitcoin Cash: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Technical Analysis (June 28, 2018)	There is a supremacy “war” going on between BTC and Bitcoin Cash but the common thing is that both are bleeding. At current prices, $600 is but some ticks away and that means caution since there have been reaction at this level when we point out Bitcoin Cash daily price chart. Today, I propose staying neutral with the usual bearish skew. That’s unless there is a spike breaking above $850, our immediate resistance line which also doubles up as a bull trigger line.\nFrom the News\nSo, just like big banks-whose failure can cause an economic meltdown-are subject to stress tests, BitPico plans to unleash their attack nodes. Their overall objectives are simple: stress test Roger Ver’s Bitcoin Cash network.\nBitPico are a group of developers who are clearly-pro Bitcoin (BTC) and with their planned attack, they are ready to show the whole world how “easy it is to take down the Bitcoin Cash network” and make “Roger Ver Cry”. This seems to be a retaliation and a show of proof following Bitcoin Cash claims that they indeed did their own stress test. In their response, BitPico says their independent tests will go on to show how Bitcoin Cash is “centralized and controlled”. Already this promises to be an interesting event. Like all stress tests, the results following this intentional attack would reveal the depth and robustness of the Bitcoin Cash network.\n\nWe've created a @github repository for the Stage 1 #bcash $bch network test toolkit. https://t.co/X5hHXoWJSf Hopefully others will compile and help test once pushed. We expect 1 stage every 28 days until all 3 stages are running in-parallel. #cryptocurrency #cybersecurity \n— ɃitPico (@bitPico) June 24, 2018\n\nThe members behind this group are strong supporters of Segwit 2x and Bitcoin’s LN development. However, despite disappointing events following issues around Segwit 2X implementation-that eventually birthed BCH, the fact that Segwit is live is overly positive. After adoption by full nodes, settlement time and network fees have seen significant improvements. In fact statistics shows that Bitcoin fees were once lower than Bitcoin Cash’s at some point.\n\nThe #bcash $bch @bitcoin attack has been started; it will continue to run as we work to amplify it over the coming months. We expect to have 5000 Bcash attack nodes in roughly 6 weeks and then we will multi-fork the chain. @rogerkver will now cry . #hacking #skills #security pic.twitter.com/dR8ksy6Lz8\n— ɃitPico (@bitPico) June 22, 2018\n\nIn a series of tweets, the core members of BitPico whose identities are not yet available to the public said they are ready to carry out a 51 percent attack. Unfortunately for Bitcoin Cash, these guys know their thing. They have successfully stress-tested Bitcoin’s Lightning Network after launching a coordinated attack receiving applause from Andreas Antonopoulos in the process.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Technical Analysis\nWeekly Chart\nBitcoin Cash Weekly Chart by Trading View\nRegardless of the drama and shills, the fact that BCH is on free fall is a cause of concern. Week over week, statistics from different coin trackers shows that it is down 20 percent and complementing last week’s bear pressure. While we remain bearish until we see hints of higher highs, the simple fact that we are so close to the main support line at $600 as the weekly chart shows means either we lock in some profits or pause taking shorts for the time being.\nDaily Chart\nBitcoin Cash Daily Chart by Trading View\nLike it has been the case in the past two months after prices peaked in late April, sellers are in charge. As aforementioned, either we take a wait and see approach as bears test $600 or sell and aim for $300 with sell profits locked. The reasoning is simple, $600 like $6,000 in BTC are influential price tags and regions of strong technical support. Now, should there be a depreciation below them, aim for $300 which is also Bitcoin Cash all-time lows.\nThe post BitPico Ready to Launch a 51% Attack on Bitcoin Cash: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Technical Analysis (June 28, 2018) appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/bitcoin-cash-bch-technical-analysis-june-28-2018/	2018-06-28 00:04:57+00	15

86	Malta Passes Crypto Friendly Regulations	Malta has lately been trying to establish the island nation as a haven for cryptocurrency businesses seeking more lax regulations and the ability to operate more freely. \nBinance moved from Hong Kong to Malta earlier this year due to the island nation’s friendly cryptocurrency-related jurisdictions, and a Bloomberg report has noted that a majority of the world’s cryptocurrency was being traded through Malta – at least legally speaking.\n\nIt would seem that Malta has no intention of stopping this campaign, as the Maltese parliament held a vote on three blockchain and cryptocurrency bills yesterday, which passed unanimously.\n\nThe bills are specifically meant to boost Malta’s attractiveness even further in relation to blockchain firms and will make it easier to start blockchain and cryptocurrency companies in Malta.\n\nMalta’s Parliament Secretary for Digital Innovation, Silvio Schembri, tweeted that he was ”honored to have driven these bills” through the Maltese parliament, and expressed gratitude to all those involved with the project.\n\nMoreover, Schembri also announced that the ”Malta Digital Innovation Authority” which will be created following this vote, will be led by Mr. Stephen McCarty. Schemers was also adamant that these bills will give the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology the means to flourish.\n\nThe first of these bills was dubbed the Malta Digital Innovation Authority Bill and brings a wide array of cryptocurrency-related regulations. More specifically, it also entails the creation of the authority which McCarty will now lead as CEO.\n\nIn addition to this, the affairs of the Malta Digital Innovation Authority will be carried out by a board of governors. The authority will also survey and certify DLT platforms, in order to “ensure credibility”.\n\nAnother of the three bills was the Technology Arrangements and Services Bill, which is meant to address the possibility of allowing so-called “Technology Service Providers” and “Technology Arrangements” to have the Technological Arrangement being granted. Separate legal personality.\n\nMoreover, the Virtual Financial Assets Bill was the third bill, which focused on regulations pertaining to initial coin offerings (ICOs). Furthermore, this bill will deal with the regulatory framework that cryptocurrency exchanges will fall under.\n\nMaltese comments in regards to the bills have already been overwhelmingly positive, which certainly highlight the attitude of the Maltese government. \n\nMoreover, as Malta has already attracted several big players within in cryptocurrency field, these latest pieces of legislation should not come as a surprise. Nonetheless, it will be interesting to see what further steps Malta takes to become the undisputed “cryptocurrency capital” of Europe.\n\nToday Maltese Parliament unanimously approved 3 bills on DLT/blockchain, a 1st in the World. Honored to have driven these bills. Announced that Mr Stephen McCarthy will be the CEO of the new #Malta Digital Innovation Authority.  #BlockchainIsland -SS\n— Silvio Schembri (@SilvioSchembri) June 26, 2018\n\nImage Source: “Flickr”\n \nThe post Malta Passes Crypto Friendly Regulations appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/malta-passes-crypto-friendly-regulations/	2018-06-27 18:13:20+00	16
30	Digital Payment Platform Uphold Inks Deal to Acquire New York Broker-Dealer	Uphold, a cloud-based financial services platform, has inked a deal to acquire New York-based broker-dealer JNK Securities Corp., in the latest move by a crypto platform to move itself towards traditional markets. \nThe deal, if approved, will give JNK clients access to crypto trading, potentially bringing new institutional investors to Uphold’s platform and the larger crypto ecosystem.\nUphold Acquiring JNK Securities\nAccording to Bloomberg, terms of the agreement have not yet been disclosed. If the deal gets the green light from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Uphold will then seek approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as an alternative trading system (ATS). Although not a public house (like the New York Stock Exchange), an ATS can provide many of the same functions of matching buyers with sellers of securities.\n\n“Many crypto assets (particularly ICO tokens) may be treated as securities in some cases,” Uphold CEO Adrian Steckel said in a statement. “Through Uphold’s new securities division, the digital currency platform would be able to offer sales and trading of ICO tokens and fractional equities and provide other exchange services.”\n\nUphold’s move follows similar acquisitions by larger U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges. Coinbase said earlier this month that it’s buying a trio of firms, including a broker-dealer, to offer customers blockchain-based securities. Around the same time as the Coinbase announcement, peer-to-peer trading platform Circle Internet Financial Ltd. said that it intends to pursue registration as a brokerage and trading venue with the SEC in attempts to help investors buy and sell tokens deemed to be securities.\nRegulated trading platforms like Uphold will likely be eventually handling billions of dollars in tokens sold by companies in initial coin offerings (ICOs). Despite a crackdown by the U.S., China, and other countries, startups raised more than $6.3 billion through ICOs in the first three months of the year, easily surpassing the total accumulated for the whole of 2017. \nThe SEC recently clarified that it considers most coins to be securities. This puts Uphold in a good position, as the SEC’s decision means issuers must register and comply with federal laws, as the platform is doing.\nUphold\nUphold, which brands itself as a ‘cloud money vault,’ is not strictly a cryptocurrency exchange. It’s more like a bank for buying and holding different currencies, converting them into other currencies, or sending them to other members internationally.\nThe site was launched in 2014 under the name Bitreserve, and was founded by CNET founder Halsey Minor. When it first launched, customers had to make their first deposits in Bitcoin, but could then convert Bitcoin into other digital (or fiat) currencies when they wanted to withdraw funds or send money abroad.\nIn 2015, Bitreserve changed its name to Uphold and began allowing customers to deposit money into their accounts via bank transfer or credit or debit cards. With the boom in cryptocurrencies over the past year, the platform is certainly embracing the nascent industry. Uphold’s website declares that users can go, ‘from U.S. dollar to bitcoin in seconds.’\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Digital Payment Platform Uphold Inks Deal to Acquire New York Broker-Dealer appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/digital-payment-platform-uphold-inks-deal-to-acquire-new-york-broker-dealer/	2018-06-27 23:15:21+00	10

85	$20 Million Worth of Bitcoin Seized in a Crackdown on Dark Web Vendors	The US Department of Justice (DOJ) in tandem with numerous other state agencies, such as Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) have arrested 35 dark web traders across the United States. \nThe undercover operations saw agents posing as money launderers on dark web marketplaces, where they managed to identify vendors of illicit products. Even though cryptocurrencies are often portrayed in Hollywood and popular media as a means to pay for drugs or guns on the dark web, the reality is that less than 1 percent of all BTC transactions are used for funding unlawful activities.\nNonetheless, the dark web still exists and a number of alleged criminals will likely face jail time, while the rest will surely feel anxious after hearing such news. According to the official announcement, the officials confiscated 3.6 million worth of USD and gold, a bunch of weapons including a grenade launcher, drugs, pill pressers and 2000 BTC plus other digital currencies, worth around $20 million in total.\nSpeaking on the success of the operation Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein said that, “Criminals who think that they are safe on the Darknet are wrong. We can expose their networks, and we are determined to bring them to justice. Today, we arrested more than 35 alleged Darknet vendors. We seized their weapons, their drugs, and $23.6 million of their ill-gotten gains.“\nHSI Executive Associate Director Derek Benner added that, “The Darknet is ever-changing and increasingly more intricate, making locating and targeting those selling illicit items on this platform more complicated. But in this case, HSI special agents were able to walk amongst those in the cyber underworld to find those vendors who sell highly addictive drugs for a profit. […] HSI has infiltrated the Darknet, and together with its law enforcement partners nationwide, it has proven, once again, that every criminal is within arm’s reach of the law.“\nThe overwhelming majority of BTC and other digital currencies that were seized, belonged to 2 of the 35 arrested vendors – Maryland residents Ryan Farace and Robert Swain. According to the indictment, “Farace distributed alprazolam tablets through sales on the dark web in exchange for Bitcoin, and that Farace and Swain laundered the drug proceeds through financial transactions designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.“\nThis is not the first time US authorities seize BTC and other cryptocurrencies in a dark web operation. The most notable case was the arrest of the owner of now-defunct Silk Road – the biggest dark web marketplace at the time. US Government seized a staggering 80,000 BTC at the time and auctioned them from 2013 to 2014. Earlier this year, an auction of over 3,800 BTC was held by the US Marshal Service.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post $20 Million Worth of Bitcoin Seized in a Crackdown on Dark Web Vendors appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/20-million-worth-of-bitcoin-seized-in-a-crackdown-on-dark-web-vendors/	2018-06-27 18:30:37+00	1
29	A Fifth of UK Millennials Would Rather Invest in Bitcoin Than in Real Estate	Bitcoin, a digital asset most people would consider a high-risk investment, is progressively becoming an option for millennials who find that putting money into property is not the wisest choice. A research study conducted in the United Kingdom found that 21% of the population aged between 21 and 35 would rather invest in Bitcoin instead of property.\nBitcoin Is Better Than Real Estate for 21% of Millennials\nUK-based build-to-rent developer Get Living conducted a poll among 3,000 millennials to better understand their position on property investment. It found out that three-quarters said they believe there are more rewarding investments to be made than putting money into real estate.\nThe study found that 57% of millennials consider property a ‘high risk’ investment decision over the next five years and Bitcoin is seen as a better investment by 21% of them.\n“For Millennials the soaring performance of Bitcoin – followed by an almost equally profound correction – holds more intrigue than the prospect of steady growth in house prices. This translated to 27% of male Millennials polled believing Bitcoin represents a better investment than property.”\nOver a third of homeowner participants in the poll said that the value of their property dropped in first 12 months and 57% admitted to having underestimated the cost of buying their first home. Monthly costs for 45% of them are much higher than when they were renting and 49% lived in more convenient locations before becoming home owners.\nNeil Young, chief executive of Get Living, analyzed the insights into ‘a generation in the vanguard of the new on-demand subscription society.’\n“What we’ve found in this report is that ‘generation rent’ are cautious when it comes to property investment, are optimistic for the future and value the flexibility that renting offers. These shifts can’t be ignored.”\nRobert Shiller, the U.S. economist and Nobel Laureate for his work on speculative manias including the housing bubble, has been vocal about bitcoin, recently calling it an ‘epidemic of enthusiasm.’ The Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale University said Bitcoin is another attempt at reinventing money and that no one can explain how cryptocurrencies work.\nCryptocurrency entrepreneurs are addressing virtually every business sector, including the real estate market. WestLand Storage Company, who has been operating on real estate for over 17 years, has recently launched a blockchain-based technology that aims to decentralize the real estate market and tokenize any real estate.\nThe Floating Island Project, founded by billionaire cryptocurrency enthusiast Peter Thiel and Patri Friedman, is set to develop an off-shore housing that uses its own currency and operates outside of government regulations. If the pilot program works out, the project aims to build hundreds of islands over the years.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post A Fifth of UK Millennials Would Rather Invest in Bitcoin Than in Real Estate appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/27/a-fifth-of-uk-millennials-would-rather-invest-in-bitcoin-than-in-real-estate/	2018-06-27 22:15:36+00	103

83	Nobel Prize-winning Economist Robert Shiller Calls Bitcoin a ‘Social Movement’	Yale’s Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller spoke out on the Bitcoin phenomenon in an interview to Bloomberg on Tuesday, June 26th. The economist calls the cryptocurrency a social movement and an epidemic of enthusiasm. Shiller has previously explained his outlook on crypto and stays consistent with his views. The Nobel prize winner and Yale Sterling Professor of Economics claims that the Bitcoin phenomenon fundamentally is a speculative bubble.\nIn the television interview, Shiller agreed to the statement of Bitcoin being a generational phenomenon. He also pointed out a geographical division in the popularity of the technology. \n“It is generational and geographic. East coast is less into it than the West coast. Silicon Valley is really into it.”\nSuch unsystematic behavior in the adoption of the cryptocurrencies serves as an indicator of irrational response to a new information, according to Yale’s professor. Shiller recognizes the nature of a speculative bubble due to exclusive demographics of Bitcoin. Similar to the historical study cases, that the Nobel prize Laureate often capitalizes on, Shiller points out periodic reoccurrences of major price drops, exemplary of speculative behavior. He referred to a drastic decline in the bitcoin prize in 2013, famously plummeting down from the handsome $1 163 to $152 US. The bear market over 411 days happened in the wake of Mt Gox exchange collapse.\nDuring the interview, Shiller was asked to draw a parallel between the incident of tulip mania and the surge of cryptocurrencies. Shiller responded in a sarcastic manner. \n“I don’t know what it means to equate it to that. And by the way, tulips are still valued, there are still some expensive tulips.”\nThe economist also provided a more elaborate explanation. Shiller makes a point that the cryptocurrency innovations have drawn disproportionate and undeserved attention because of investors’ will to grow rich immediately.\n“There is also some impressive cryptographic theory that is coming out of computer scientists. This particular invention has so much more attention. Do you know what is going on inside of your laptop? There are millions of interesting stories about brilliant engineering devices that are in there. But we do not hear about them, that is because they are not part of a bubble. They are not part of investment excitement about a possibility of getting rich over this.”\nRobert James Shiller Shiller jointly received the 2013 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, “for their empirical analysis of asset prices”. as a Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale University and runs an investment management firm MacroMarkets LLC. He is known for prediction of dotcom and housing bubbles and warning about the crises when the bubbles burst. Shiller is often quoted stating Bitcoin being the biggest financial bubble at present. The economist uses the empirical approach in his analysis and bases conclusions on the failed monetary examples of 19th and 20th centuries, often appealing to the works of historical figures, such as Karl Marx and Robert Owen.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Nobel Prize-winning Economist Robert Shiller Calls Bitcoin a ‘Social Movement’ appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/nobel-prize-winning-economist-robert-shiller-calls-bitcoin-a-social-movement/	2018-06-27 16:11:23+00	0

84	Australian Central Bank Admires Bitcoin But Doesn’t See it Replacing Fiat	Central banks govern most of the country’s wealth, and thus most are feeling threatened by the exposure cryptocurrency has got in mainstream economics. Australian Central Bank’s opinion about cryptocurrency was stated to the Australian Business Economists in Sydney yesterday, 26th June.\nTony Richards, an official from the Reserve Bank of Australia said,\n“Even if one is quite skeptical of whether bitcoin will have a significant role in the economy in the future, I think it is hard to avoid some admiration for its design.”\nTony Richard is the head of Australia’s payment policy department and is known to own a small amount of bitcoin too which he acquired back in June 2014. \n “When a country doesn’t have a credible currency, then people might look for other ones. Whether those are cryptocurrencies or something like the US dollar is another issue, but we in Australia have a perfectly credible currency called the Australian dollar; we’ve had low and stable inflation for at least 25 years; and the likelihood that we’d have significant adoption of an alternative currency seems to be pretty low,” he continued.\nTony Richards may be a fan of Bitcoin; however, he notices that Bitcoin won’t have much to do for the people of Australia as they are pretty satisfied using the Australian Dollar.\nRichards also touched on the volatility issues of Bitcoin, and claimed that “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are yet to establish themselves as reliable stores of value.”\nRichards pointed out the higher transaction fees that undermine the legitimacy of Bitcoin.\nRichards proved to the public his knowledge by bringing front more technical issues of Bitcoin by saying,  “This episode points to the scalability and governance problems of the bitcoin system.“Bitcoin’s lack of a central governance structure has been a weakness in dealing with the capacity problem that results from the fact that the original protocol limits the block size to no more than 1 megabyte.”\nHe even spoke about the numerous security concerns which put Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies at risk. \n “And there have also been many hacks of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets over the past few years. That shows there is also a lot more risk in bitcoin intermediaries than there is in the supervised banks and financial institutions in which households can hold their Australian dollars.”\nHe cleared the air that the Australian Central Bank won’t be pursuing their own cryptocurrency.\n“So for the time being at least, consideration of a possible new electronic form of money provided by the Reserve Bank to households is not something that we are actively pursuing.”\nWhile Australian Central Bank’s official may not opt for cryptocurrency, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney has shown his interest in a central bank issued digital currency. \nCryptocurrencies will be helpful for most of the unbanked and are seen to hold a valid place in mainstream economics for people who don’t believe in the traditional banking system.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Australian Central Bank Admires Bitcoin But Doesn’t See it Replacing Fiat appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/australian-central-bank-admires-bitcoin-but-doesnt-see-it-replacing-fiat/	2018-06-27 12:02:58+00	0
87	Cryptocurrency Market Update: Zilliqa (ZIL) Spurts on New Exchange Listing	FOMO Moments\nCrypto land is stagnant, a few altcoins are afloat; Zilliqa, Ethereum Classic, Icon and Bytom.\nMarkets have remained stable today, which could be considered a good thing because they haven’t plunged any further. There has been very little momentum in the way of a recovery indicating that further losses are likely. Total market capitalization is still below $250 billion with little signs of a rebound.\nBitcoin has remained flat on the day, trading at the same level it was this time yesterday, around $6,100. Trade volume for BTC has declined marginally from $3.4 billion to $3.2 billion and market cap is hovering around $105 billion. Bitcoin dipped to $6k suddenly a few hours ago but found support and did not slide further. Ethereum has had a tough week and has not moved in the past 24 hours, remaining at $435. Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS and Litecoin are marginally up 2-3% but none are showing any real bullish sentiments.\nThe rest of the altcoins are a mixed bunch as markets remain stagnant for the time being. The only one showing any kind of positive movement at the moment is Zilliqa which is up 8.3% according to Coinmarketcap. ZIL is currently trading at $0.067, marginally up from yesterday’s level of $0.063. Over the past week it has lost 23% and over the month 40% as cryptos have been crushed. Against Bitcoin ZIL is up 8% on the day to 1100 satoshis. On the week however it has lost 15% against BTC falling from 1300 satoshis this time last Thursday.\n\nThe short pump has come from a Coinone listing a couple of hours ago;\n\n질리카 (Zilliqa) 상장 안내 / Zilliqa listing announcement\n코인원이 질리카 (Zilliqa)를 상장합니다.\n– 입출금 가능 시기 : 2018년 06월 28일 오후 12시 (KST)– 거래 가능 시기 : 2018년 06월 28일 오후 4시 (KST) (예정)\n자세한 사항은 코인원 공식홈페이지를 참고해주시기 바랍니다. pic.twitter.com/soBF19aTir\n— Coinone (@coinone_info) June 28, 2018\n\nZIL is mostly traded on Binance with 23% of the total volume, followed by Huobi with a similar level.

88	Ripple Price Analysis: XRP/USD Consolidating Losses	Key Highlights\n\nRipple price traded close to the $0.4750 resistance where it faced sellers against the US dollar.\nThere is a short-term ascending channel in place with support at $0.4620 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).\nThe pair could break the channel support and $0.4600 for a downside extension in the near term.\n\nRipple price is currently consolidating losses against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. XRP/USD may perhaps resume its decline if it fails to move above $0.4750 and $0.4800.\nRipple Price Resistances\nThere was a short-term low formed recently near $0.4470 in Ripple price against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair started a minor upside correction and traded above the $0.4550 resistance. It succeeded in moving above the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $0.4930 high to $0.4478 low. However, the upside move faced a lot of selling interest near the $0.4750 resistance.\nThe price failed to settle above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $0.4930 high to $0.4478 low. A fresh downside wave was initiated and the price moved back below $0.4700. It seems like there is a short-term ascending channel in place with support at $0.4620 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair could bounce back from the channel support at $0.4620. However, to initiate a decent recovery, the price has to move above the $0.4750 resistance. Above this, the next hurdles for buyers are at $0.4800 and $0.4900.\n\nLooking at the chart, if the price fails to hold the $0.4620 and $0.4600 support, it could retest the $0.4470 swing low. The overall price structure is negative as long as XRP/USD is below $0.5000. On the downside, the most important support sits around $0.4200.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is about to move back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now back below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $0.4600\nMajor Resistance Level – $0.4750\nThe post Ripple Price Analysis: XRP/USD Consolidating Losses appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/ripple-price-analysis-xrp-usd-consolidating-losses/	2018-06-28 06:30:40+00	0

90	Exclusive: Coinbase Will Add GBP Support to Ease Withdrawals in UK	The Coinbase UK CEO has confirmed that support for GBP withdrawals and deposits will be rolled out over the next few weeks. In an interview with NewsBTC, he also said that Coinbase Custody has had a ‘lot of interest’ and that they have had to restrict how many investors they can take on.\nSupport for GBP Payments Incoming\nCoinbase UK CEO Zeeshan Feroz said that Coinbase will be supporting GBP wires in the next few weeks. At present, Coinbase use Estonian bank LHV to process payments which are all done in euros. UK users have to withdraw euros from Coinbase using SEPA transfers or via mobile banking apps such as Revolut.\nIn March, Coinbase partnered with UK bank Barclays which opened them up to both GBP payments and the Faster Payments Scheme. This is one of the first collaborations where a UK bank has agreed to accept money that was previously held as a cryptocurrency.\nFeroz told NewsBTC: “The biggest thing for me is rolling out access to faster payments for UK consumers. It’s been a huge challenge for us and I think it was a good result for us to get access to that. Over the next few weeks, we’ll be rolling that out for all customers. UK users will be able to deposit Sterling and withdraw Sterling out into their bank accounts using faster payments.”\nHuge Interest by Institutional Investors\nCurrently, 6% of Bitcoin transactions are made in GBP and the UK economy is the fifth largest by GDP. Feroz has previously pointed out that the UK market is the largest in Europe. However, Coinbase are not just looking to attract individuals but have recently launched a suite of products aimed at instituitonal investors.\nOn Coinbase Custody, he said: “We have had a lot of interest in custody. We have a pipeline of business, we selected a handful that we’re launching with and we will look to add more on. At the minute, we’re restricting the funnel as to how much we can take on until we feel the project is mature and we’ve taken on the first few customers and ironed out the initial kinks. Then we’ll open it up more.”\nWhen asked if Coinbase will always support the same coins and tokens on both their consumer products and their instituional products, Feroz made reference to recently-acquired Paradex, an exchange based on the 0x protocol which offers support for ERC20 tokens. Coinbase also said recently that they plan to support ERC20 tokens.\nFeroz said: “We will start to take a product-specific view in terms of the regulatory profiles of coins and the service they’re providing and if that allows us to extend it beyond the four coins we have, then that’s what we’ll do. You will see our businesses as they grow, the coins supported will maybe diverge. One example of that is Paradex which today is live in Europe with eight coins.”\nFeroz also said that while they are looking for regulatory certainty, it is not getting in the way of adding new tokens. He said Coinbase will ‘continue to look into tokens that aren’t securites and add them in the future.’ Pointing out their new broken-dealer and ATS licences in the US, he said that they will be able to offer tokens that are registered with the SEC.\nThe post Exclusive: Coinbase Will Add GBP Support to Ease Withdrawals in UK appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/coinbase-adding-gbp-support-next-weeks/	2018-06-28 07:00:14+00	5
91	Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak Says Blockchain is a ‘Bubble’ but Still Thinks Bitcoin is ‘Amazing’	Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has added his two cents about Blockchain at the NEX technology conference in New York. His statements are a tad bit confusing as he finds it a bubble with a lot of potential for real-world scenarios.\nSteve Wozniak along with Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Computer Inc. which was the pioneer of modern day personal computers from the 1970’s onwards.\nOn stage at the conference, Steve Wozniak spoke about Blockchain’s similarities to the dotcom era where companies related to the internet were being hyped tremendously. “It was a bubble, and I feel that way about blockchain,” he said.\nThe dotcom bubble occurred from 1997 to 2001 where extreme growth took place because of the internet however it led to many companies crashing when the bubble burst.\nWozniak is known to hold some Bitcoins, and thus complemented the Blockchain system too with words such as “decentralized and totally trustworthy.” \nWozniak pointed out that Blockchain ideas need to be thought for in the long run to avoid complications similar to the dotcom bubble.\n“If you look now you say all that internet stuff happened, we got it, it just took a while, It doesn’t change in a day, a lot of the blockchain ideas that are really good by coming out early they can burn themselves out by not being prepared to be stable in the long run.”\nWozniak spoke about his Bitcoin experience at the conference.\n “All of the sudden it was way down, then way up in the sky. I got scared, and sold everything but one bitcoin,” he said. \nIn October 2017, at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas, Wozniak was seen showering a lot of praise to Blockchain. Especially to Bitcoin by stating Bitcoin was better than both gold and the US dollar.\nLet us know what you think the late great co-founder of Apple Steve Jobs would have said about Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies if he was alive today!\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak Says Blockchain is a ‘Bubble’ but Still Thinks Bitcoin is ‘Amazing’ appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-says-blockchain-is-a-bubble-but-still-thinks-bitcoin-is-amazing/	2018-06-28 07:21:18+00	0

93	Ethereum Classic Price Analysis: Can ETC/USD Surpass $16?	Key Highlights\n\nEthereum classic price is trading nicely above the $14.25 support area against the US dollar.\nThere is a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $15.60 on the hourly chart of the ETC/USD pair (Data feed via Kraken).\nThe pair has to clear the $15.60 and $16.00 resistance levels to gain upside momentum in the near term.\n\nEthereum classic price is slowly moving in a positive zone against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ETC/USD could accelerate gains above $16.00 if buyers gain control.\nEthereum Classic Price Resistance\nThere was a decent upside move in ETC price above the $14.25 and $15.00 resistance levels against the US dollar. The ETC/USD pair traded close to the $16.00 resistance, which prevented further gains. There were a couple of attempts by buyers to break $16.00, but they failed. As a result, the price declined and moved below $15.00. There was a break below the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $13.21 low to $16.03 high.\nThe price also cleared the 100 hourly simple moving average, but it found support near $14.25. Moreover, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $13.21 low to $16.03 high also provided support. ETC price bounced back and is currently trading above $15.00 and the 100 hourly SMA. On the upside, there is a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $15.60 on the hourly chart of the ETC/USD pair. Above the trend line, the most important hurdle for buyers is near the $16.00 level.\n\nThe chart suggests that the price is slowly moving into a positive zone above $15.00. However, it must clear the $15.60 and $16.00 resistances to gain traction. On the downside, supports are seen near $14.60 and $14.25 levels.\nHourly MACD – The MACD for ETC/USD is currently flat in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI – The RSI for ETC/USD is holding the 50 level with positive signs.\nMajor Support Level – $14.25\nMajor Resistance Level – $16.00\nThe post Ethereum Classic Price Analysis: Can ETC/USD Surpass $16? appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/ethereum-classic-price-analysis-can-etc-usd-surpass-16/	2018-06-28 08:00:35+00	5

96	Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Remains Range Bound	Key Points\n\nBitcoin price is stuck in a tight range between the $6,000 and $6,300 levels against the US Dollar.\nThere is a declining channel forming with resistance near $6,180 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\nThe pair must clear the trend line, $6,200 and $6,300 resistance levels to gain upside momentum.\n\nBitcoin price remained in a range above $6,000 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD needs to clear the $6,200-6,300 hurdle for an extended recovery in the near term.\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nDuring the past three sessions, there was no major move above $6,220 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair remained confined in a range below the $6,300 resistance. The best part was the fact that buyers managed to hold the $6,000 support. It is currently flirting with the 100 hourly simple moving average and $6,100. Recently, it dipped a few points and tested the $6,000 support.\nThere was a test of the 50% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $5,660 swing low to $6,340 swing high. However, buyers appeared and protected a downside break below $6,000. There is a declining channel forming with resistance near $6,180 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. As long as the price is above the $6,000 support, there are chances of an upside move. A break below $6,000 may put a lot of pressure on buyers and the price could drop back to $5,660. On the flip side, an upside break above $6,180 will most likely call for a test of the $6,300 resistance.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price is mostly trading in a range above the $6,000. There are a few positive signs, but an upside break above $6,200-6,300 won’t be easy in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is mostly flat in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving around the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $6,000\nMajor Resistance Level – $6,180\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Remains Range Bound appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/bitcoin-price-watch-btc-usd-remains-range-bound/	2018-06-28 08:28:43+00	0
97	Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Will be Key to Japan’s Economic Resurgence	The CEO of SBI, one of Japan’s financial giants and longtime Ripple partner in Asia, said he believes that investment and early adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology will be key to the country’s next economic boom.\nSBI CEO Looks to Blockchain for Economic Boom\nAt the first annual Japanese Blockchain Conference in Tokyo CEO Yoshitaka Kitao talked about his belief in blockchain to get Japan’s economy back on track to regain the global position it once held. The Chief Executive Officer of one Japan’s largest financial service providers was quoted by Forbes:\n“We want to take blockchain beyond financial, there’s a lot of speculative demand around cryptocurrencies, which is why the price is going up so quickly, but people need to think about how these technologies are being used in real life and how they can improve people’s businesses.”\nJapan had the second largest GDP in the world (after the US) from the mid – 1970’s through the 1980’s. By the 1990’s however, things changed and the country fell into an economic slump known as the lost decade in Japan.\nSBI is investing in tech companies focused on improving mobile connectivity with 5G technology, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) through the $460 million AI &amp; Blockchain Fund the company established earlier this year.\nFee Free Crypto Exchange Part of Investment Fund\nSBI has had a partnership with Ripple since it invested in the company in 2016. As co-owners and operaters of SBI – Ripple Asia they have been dedicated to exploring the use of Ripple’s blockchain to improve international bank transfers. SBI launched its own cryptcurrency exchange earlier this month. VCTRADE charges no transactions fees and is focused on trading XRP, the native token of the San Francisco based company.\nThe exchange plans to add support for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in the coming months as well as including fees for withdrawing yen, though no official date has been given for any of the changes yet.\nThe company has also reportedly invested in a renewable energy wind farm to mine Bitcoin Cash which Kitao says has the utility potential that Bitcoin lacks. “Bitcoin is too expensive and people are just holding it and hoping it increase in value,” The CEO said before continuing on about the necessity of real utility in technology,\n“There’s a lot of speculative demand around cryptocurrencies, which is why the price is going up so quickly, but people need to think about how these technologies are being used in real life and how they can improve people’s businesses.”\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Will be Key to Japan’s Economic Resurgence appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/ripple-partner-sbis-ceo-says-blockchain-will-be-key-to-japans-economic-resurgence/	2018-06-28 09:00:49+00	3

101	Hong Kong Regulators to Remain Vigilant on Cryptocurrency	Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has released its annual report in which it states the commision will continue to monitor the cryptocurrency market and step in with penalties when it needs to.\nSFC Will Remain Vigilant\nThe document highlights the risks tied to investing in the emerging technologies and especially singles out initial coin offerings (ICO) as a hotbed of fraud.\nAs detailed in the report the SFC took regulatory action against crypto exchanges and ICO issuers in the past year. In February letters were sent out to crypto exchanges warning them not to become involved in trading without a license as the tokens are considered a security defined by the Securities and Futures Ordinance. They also sent out seven letters to ICO issuers informing them of the SFC’s regulation, while some opted to end their offering most complied.\nThe report also contains information on the country’s regulatory sandbox which is meant to allow companies to “conduct regulated activities utilizing financial technologies.” In addition, the SFC announced a partnership with the Investor Education Center to create a campaign which will strive to inform potential investors about the risks associated with ICO’s and cryptocurrencies.\nIn this way, Hong Kong is following other countries who have been proactive in protecting the public from predatory investment schemes in the crypto market. The US SEC even launched a phony ICO called Howey Coin replete with a website sporting all the usual trappings of a fraudulent ICO from guarantees of massive returns to the endorsement of (in this case fake) celebrities. When a visitor to the site clicked on the invest button they were sent to an SEC page with information on ICO and cryptocurrency scams.\nHong Kong Among Many Others to Inform Investors\nThe SEC set up its cybercrime division in September of 2017, before ICO’s became the dominant revenue generating source they are today, in order to enforce established regulation but also to inform the public and pursue bad actors in the space involved in crimes outside of most jurisdictions like creating pyramid schemes and manipulating digital coin markets.\nThe SFC’s efforts to inform Hong Kong’s public about the dangers inherent in crypto-based investment may be seen as a positive part of the region’s regulatory vigor since the 2017 Bitcoin Bull market focused government attention on the space, but it was also new regulation that caused Binance, the worlds largest crypto exchange, to seek a friendlier atmosphere for their business. First in Japan, and more recently to Malta which has groomed itself as a haven for crypto and blockchain related companies.\nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Hong Kong Regulators to Remain Vigilant on Cryptocurrency appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/hong-kongs-sfc-vows-to-remain-vigilant-crypto-market-regulation/	2018-06-28 10:00:54+00	0

104	New ERC-1155 Standard Brings Ethereum Technology to the Gaming Industry	A lot of things continue to happen behind the scenes of Ethereum. Another new token standard is about to be introduced in the coming weeks. Known as ERC-1155, this new standard is mainly designed for the video gaming industry.  Merging that industry with blockchain can lead to some intriguing developments down the line. \nTackling Gaming With Ethereum\nThere has been a visible increase in the world of blockchain assets. It is only a matter of time until more industries take notice of this technology as well. For video gamers, it seems blockchain-based assets can play a vital role of importance. The newly introduced ERC-721 token standard is one of the ways to reshape this growing industry as more time progresses. \nIt now seems another new standard is trying to make inroads in the gaming industry. Known as ERC-1155, it is designed to become an “evolved token”. Unlike previous models, the new token standard stores items in a single contract. Moreover, this is done in such a way it requires very little data to distinguish the tokens from others. \nFurthermore, this token is proposed as a means of convenience. Exchanging these tokens can be done very easily and without big intermediary steps. Instead, everything is handled by the crypto items contract itself. It makes the process of swapping assets or having them change ownership a lot more straightforward moving forward. \nCan ERC-1155 Succeed?\nWith a very strong focus on efficiency, it is evident ERC-1155 has a leg up over other standards. It appears to be a lot more straightforward. Gone are the days in which individual assets need to be swapped one at a time. This new standard allows for the instant transfer and conversion of any number of items through one process. \nAccording to the accompanying blog post, up to 200 operations can be performed per transaction. That is quite a milestone in terms of scalability. More importantly, this system will work with both fungible and non-fungible items. That gives ERC-1155 a leg up over other standards as well. For video gaming enthusiasts, this solution is easily the most straightforward option\nThe big question is whether or not game developers will embrace this concept. After all, they need to incorporate this technology in order to make it more accessible. Bigger game titles may not necessarily see the merit of ERC-1155 right away. For the time being, the standard has been submitted to the Ethereum GitHub repository where it awaits feedback.\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post New ERC-1155 Standard Brings Ethereum Technology to the Gaming Industry appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/new-erc-1155-standard-brings-ethereum-technology-to-the-video-gaming-industry/	2018-06-28 11:00:34+00	0

110	Pornhub to Accept TRX While Tron Buys BitTorrent for $118 Million	From lithographs to polaroids to VHS, pornography has been a key to pushing forward technology as far back as recorded history. A dirty secret maybe but one that Tron founder Justin Sun must recognize as he has partnered with Pornhub.\nPornhub Accepting TRX and Zcash Soon\nPornhub, which recently made payments available with the cryptocurrency Verge (XVG), will now soon be accepting Tron’s TRX as well as Zcash (ZEC) as payment for all their services. “Decentralized payment systems have continued to grow in popularity, and cryptocurrency adoption is exploding across a broad economic spectrum,” Pornhub VP Corey Price said in a statement that went on to add:\n“Today, cryptocurrencies are especially viable in the adult entertainment industry because they are privacy-centric and incorporate more anonymity tools than traditional tender.”\nMeanwhile, Tron founder Justin Sun has also bought the peer to peer sharing platform BitTorrent for an unconfirmed $118 million in cash, not crypto, according to the entertainment trade site Variety. BitTorrent was launched in 20o4 and has had a legacy of legal problems due to copyright infringement with a number of countries shutting down their sites and trackers.\nWith a reported 170 million users, including on its sub-client BitTorrent now, the torrent platform has been looking for a buyer for a number of years after failed negotiations with several other interested parties including TiVo.\nTron Buys BitTorrent for $118 Million\nAccording to a statement made by Tron about their plans, it “aims to be a decentralized entertainment content-sharing platform eventually leveraging blockchain and peer-to-peer network technology.”  Which according to insiders can be read to mean that BitTorrent will be used as a base to increase the number of users of TRX, much as the deal with Pornhub is meant to do.\nWhile partnering with a content provider boasting 90 million daily users, as Pornhub claims to have, using the TRX token is, on the face of it, a very good move. Others have wondered if the deal may put off companies with more traditional interests creating partnerships. Tron has been a steady climber in the market since its launch in 2017 and though its market cap is down almost 50% in the last three weeks its token is in the green at the time of writing according to livecoinwatch.\nAlong with adding both Zcash and TRX to its payment options, Pornhub has also just added a closed captioning feature for over 1,000 of its most popular videos as part of its philanthropic efforts which come under the company’s Pornhub cares umbrella.\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Pornhub to Accept TRX While Tron Buys BitTorrent for $118 Million appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/pornhub-accept-trx-tron-buys-bittorrent-118-million/	2018-06-28 12:00:27+00	0

114	Coinbase CEO Launches a Crypto Charity, Aimed at Emerging Markets	Brian Armstrong, CEO and founder of the US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, has unveiled another one of his ventures – a crypto-based charity that will help people in third world countries. The non-profit initiative, dubbed GiveCrypto, will accept donations from crypto owners in the form of BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC (virtual currencies available on Coinbase) as well as XRP and ZEC.\nThe donations, received in digital currencies will then be divided into smaller amounts and distributed across the globe, specifically aimed at emerging countries, currently undergoing through various crises. Mr. Armstrong stated that at least initially, the impoverished will be aided by direct-cash transfers of cryptocurrencies.\nAccording to him, “An increasing body of evidence shows direct-cash transfers are a very effective form of giving, as they increase people’s income, boost food consumption and dietary diversity, and are tied to improved school attendance, health care visits, household savings, and investments in productive assets.”\nThe first goal, set by the fund’s founder is to accumulate $10 million in donations and $3.5 million has already been secured, most of it coming from Armstrong himself via a $1 million donation. Other notable donors include Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox. The long-term goal of Give Crypto is ambitious – growing the fund to $1 billion by the end of 2020.\nMr. Armstrong added that, “Many who invested early in cryptocurrencies understood it could make the financial system more efficient, lower fees, and reduce transaction times. […] And almost everyone I met in the community early on believed cryptocurrency could finally bank the unbanked of the world—the billions of people who are locked out of the financial system and trapped in poverty as a result.“\nWriting in the official Medium post, the crypto entrepreneur elaborated on how most people of the people in developed economies take financial services for granted. However, over 1.7 billion adults worldwide do not have an account at a financial institution. The situation among that segment is especially dire for women who are “disproportionately excluded from the financial system.“\nInitially, some donated funds will be used to launch and maintain starting operations but eventually a structure where 100% of donations go straight to those in need is planned. Recipients of the donations will be able to either exchange the digital currency into fiat money or keep them in crypto. The fund also plans to hire “crypto ambassadors” who will teach the recipients on how to use crypto wallets.\nArmstrong concluded by saying that, “I’m passionate about unlocking the potential in cryptocurrency. When I first read the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper for bitcoin, I realized it represented an opportunity to bring economic freedom to people all over the world.“\nJust in case you have extended experience with non-profit organizations, fundraising and hiring and managing a team, GiveCrypto is still looking for an Executive Director. We reckon the competition will be quite fierce for this one.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Coinbase CEO Launches a Crypto Charity, Aimed at Emerging Markets appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/coinbase-ceo-launches-a-crypto-charity-aimed-at-emerging-markets/	2018-06-28 13:04:07+00	1

120	Meet the Startup That Will Allow You to Earn Crypto While You Game	There’s a new company on the block(chain) finally building something gamers have wanted for a long time: to get paid for playing video games. BUFF is the latest fintech project turning that vision into a reality with a new loyalty platform that “rewards gamers simply for playing.” The new concept focuses on the frustrating parts of the gaming industry that many gamers are already dealing with.\nRight now, there’s no real way to be compensated for your gaming achievements unless you’re a professional competitive player or YouTuber. Like with professional sports, most of those gaming are not professional players. Additionally, any achievements earned in-game are limited to that specific ecosystem. BUFF believes that active gamers should be rewarded for their gaming loyalty and efforts, even if split amongst different games.\n\nWhat Does the BUFF Platform Do?\nThe goal of the platform is to not only reward gamers for their efforts but to facilitate a larger gaming community too. Users earn BUFF coins by playing games in the network and performing well. Whether playing a game with different achievements, or competing against other players in an online match, users earn coins based on their skill, time spent playing, and wins. Effectively, the platform offers gamers the chance to “mine while you play” by earning coins as you game. There’s actually no “mining” involved with BUFF coins since the network is utilizing Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), but playing is exactly how users earn coins.\nBesides earning BUFF coins by gaming and winning, the network is bringing together a multitude of games to create one seamless ecosystem. One of the pain points in the gaming industry for players is game-specific ecosystems. Currencies, points, and achievements earned in one game often cannot transfer over to another game (unless it’s owned by the same company or another iteration in a franchise). Because of that, gamers often find themselves with an excess of rewards in one game that they’ve dedicated time to but have no options beyond the game for using the rewards. BUFF is fixing that by connecting games from all over the industry to create a unified economy and ecosystem. BUFF coins earned from playing one game can be used in an entirely different game if it’s on the BUFF network.\nLastly, the BUFF platform offers users an all-in-one economy to buy, sell, and trade items from all the games in the network. There’s no longer a need to seek out untrustworthy CS:GO skin selling/gambling websites because BUFF’s platform includes a secure marketplace for all those on the platform. Not only is the marketplace a much safer alternative, but gamers can use the coins they’ve earned with BUFF to purchase from others on the marketplace. The marketplace is a win-win for everyone because players are still transacting on a trusted platform and can use what they’ve already earned, rather than entering in any credit card information to earn a new skin or item for their favorite game. Who doesn’t want to earn cryptocurrencies while they game?\n\nHow Does BUFF Work?\nAnother important aspect of the new system is how the BUFF platform works. Since the blockchain is using Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) as the consensus mechanism, player rewards are not dependent on the hardware of the machine they play on. Players are “mining” in name only when playing since they’re earning coins as they complete achievements and win games. Because the network is not relying on Proof-of-Work (PoW), players don’t need an expensive rig with thousands of dollars spent on graphics cards to earn BUFF coins.\nAll gamers must do to earn BUFF coins is run the BUFF software on their gaming platform of choice while they play. BUFF has teamed up with Overwolf, a powerful company that makes new features and data tracking easy for games using overlays. The software runs while you play without being process-intensive or detracting from your gaming experience as a player. While the software is running, it will record various achievements, stats, and your progress for different rewards.\nThe BUFF Difference\nLike a frequent flyer program for the entire gaming industry, BUFF is bringing once-impossible aspirations to the market. Unlike other programs before it, BUFF combines gamers from across the industry together, on one large network. Because of BUFF’s partnership with Overwolf, the platform will have immediate access to an active monthly user base of over 15 million gamers across a variety of platforms and games.  Whether you play League of Legends, Minecraft, or Call of Duty, gamers from all over will be able to interact, play, earn, and trade under one roof.\nBy implementing blockchain technology and leveraging the agile advantages of DPoS for their platform, BUFF is offering the first real solution to previous loyalty program problems of the past. Rob Dyer, who is an adviser with the BUFF team as well as a gaming consultant and former executive at Tapjoy, Zynga, and Sony told VentureBeat that:\n“We have tried to do loyalty programs in the past, but they didn’t work because of fraud and disruption in the game economies. When Elay [CEO of BUFF] proposed this, I thought it could work because of the blockchain. It should really help with retention and engagement, which is one of the biggest problems with games today.” \nThe post Meet the Startup That Will Allow You to Earn Crypto While You Game appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/startup-that-allow-you-earn-crypto-while-you-game/	2018-06-28 13:41:30+00	0

142	Binance Resumes Trading After Maintenance Break, Following a Risk Warning	Binance, the second most popular crypto exchange in the world, according to CoinMarketCap data, has resumed its operations following an extended break due to the system upgrade. The said upgrade is likely the result of a warning by the Binance risk management team and the cause for it is still unknown.\n\n#Binance System Upgrade Completehttps://t.co/73T5MFy1sK pic.twitter.com/GEluswRhwm\n— Binance (@binance) June 27, 2018\n\nA planned system upgrade was announced on the 24th of June and was initially supposed to last only a few of hours. However, the automated security has detected a vulnerability, which causes the break to be extended for another couple of days.\nThe upgrade was finally completed at 2:45 PM UTC June 27th and as of press time normal service is resumed. The clients of the exchange can use all account-related functions, such as process deposits and withdrawals, place or cancel trades, etc.\nIn exchange for its customer patience, Binance has decreased its trading fees by 70 percent. Nonetheless, numerous users still took to social media to voice their discontent, as a number of problems, such as missing account balance or other discrepancies were reported.\n\nNot a good day for the app. On top of my balance reading $0.00…nobody wants to see that… closing the app doesn't help. Opening desktop doesn't help either. pic.twitter.com/xaMPIua15K\n— Irredeemable Patriot (@mikeydoeswork) June 27, 2018\n\nDigital currency exchanges usually experience similar issues when warned by their security teams that a potential weakness has been detected within their system. Bitfinex, another regular fixture in the top 10 of biggest crypto exchanges by 24-hour trading volume, was forced to implement a lengthy update earlier this month, as its maintenance team noticed issues that were considered as an attempt to hack the company.\nCEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao, better known as ‘CZ’ in the crypto sphere apologized for delays via his official Twitter account. However, the crypto billionaire assured that the upgrade was needed and will definitely be beneficial for Binance users in the long term.\n\nIn a complex traffic system, when you widen some roads, it may cause congestion in other areas.  We saw this today. When we see a problem, we fix it. Though process may be a little painful short term, we are in this for the long haul. Thank you for understanding and support. pic.twitter.com/eqHMzZs8UY\n— CZ (@cz_binance) June 27, 2018\n\nDuring its downtime, two newcomers have managed to overcome Binance and other industry stalwarts in the trading volume rankings. Operating on a so-called “trans-fee mining” model the Singapore-based CoinBene and Hong Kong’s Bit-Z rose straight to the top due to the investor interest in the new scheme. The new model means that said exchanges have their own token and, while traders still have to pay transaction fees in ETH or BTC, they are fully reimbursed in the said token.\nUnsurprisingly, Mr. Zhao criticised the new guys on the block, questioning their transparency and viability in the long-term.\nHowever, it seems the rise to the top was quick but also brief as Bit-Z and CoinBene have accordingly dropped to 12th and 24th spots in the rankings as of press time.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Binance Resumes Trading After Maintenance Break, Following a Risk Warning appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/binance-resumes-trading-after-maintenance-break-following-a-risk-warning/	2018-06-28 17:40:43+00	1

147	‘Whale’ Moves 48,000 Bitcoin for 4 Cents in Fees As Scaling Solutions Develop	The development of scaling solutions, along with a decrease in Bitcoin transaction throughput, has allowed for Bitcoin fees to drop under a dollar. A Bitcoin ‘whale’ utilized these dropping fees, moving 48,000 Bitcoin for just four cents.\n$290 Million Transaction for Four Cents, Where Else Can You Do That?\nBitcoin fees were the talk of the town in December 2017, as Bitcoin fees briefly reached $50 when the network confirmed nearly 400,000 transactions each day. Since then confirmed transactions have halved, dropping to an average of 200,000 transactions on a daily basis. \nChart Courtesy of Blockchain.com\nThis decrease in transactions has allowed for Bitcoin’s mempool to clear, as the network became clogged with transactions in the latter half of 2017. According to info aggregated by popular cryptocurrency infrastructure firm, Blockchain, the number of transactions waiting for confirmation has dropped by over 95%, from an average of 100,000 to 5,000.\nIt was widely speculated that Bitcoin’s critics, hell-bent on ruining Bitcoin’s credibility and reliability, purposely inflated Bitcoin transaction fees. These critics reportedly filled up Bitcoin blocks with ‘spam’ transactions, using the Bitcoin network for no real purpose. \nHowever, others observed that the exponential increase in transaction fees was also due to the growth in the interest of Bitcoin, with retail consumers looking to transact value using the ‘flavor of the month.’\nA whale, unidentified at the time of writing, has proved this point, paying four cents of fees for the transaction of over $290 million worth of Bitcoin. The transaction occurred late last night, with the Bitcoin user moving 48,500 Bitcoin for mere pennies, a far cry from the fees of late 2017. The ‘Whale’ paid 0.00000675 Bitcoin in fees, offering a rate of 3 satoshis per byte of transactional data.\nIt came as a surprise to some that a user with such a large amount of cryptocurrency holdings would pay fees well-below the rate suggested by Blockchain, at around 5 satoshis per byte. \nA Twitter user, with the handle, @martybent, said: \n“Can you imagine trying to move $300M for $0.04 using the traditional banking system? No, no you can’t.”\nHowever, users have sought for more, looking for ways to decrease transaction fees to the bare minimum, while increasing Bitcoin transaction throughput limits. This search has signaled the development of Bitcoin scaling solutions, pertinent to the future success of this world-changing network. \nScaling Solutions: Segwit and the Lightning Network\nFor the uninitiated, Segwit is an improvement on the Bitcoin network that changes the transaction format of BTC transactions. Segwit allows for transaction sizes to be reduced drastically, helping to reduce fees, along with allowing for an increased amount of transactions to be stored within one block. \nThis protocol, activated in August 2017, has already caught on with the network, as over 36% of all transactions now run on Segwit addresses. \nThe implementation of the Segwit protocol was vital in making sure that the Lightning Network, another popular scaling solution, could function. The Lightning Network is an off-chain scaling solution that promotes the use of Bitcoin for micro-payments. This specific scaling solution utilizes balance sheets, payment channels, and multi-sig addresses to ensure that all parties get the money they deserve. By using this system, thousands of transactions could be made per second for minimal fees, the holy grail for any cryptocurrency network. \nBlockstream, leading cryptocurrency infrastructure and development company, recently announced that Lightning Network adoption has grown at a staggering rate, saying: \n“Around the announcement of the Blockstream Store, the Lightning Network had a total of 46 open channels and 0.682 BTC in capacity. Today, there are roughly 7,800 open channels with 26 BTC of capacity. That is a 16,856% increase in channels and a 4,084% increase in channel capacity in 6 months!”\nHopefully, the adoption of scaling solutions can continue, as Bitcoin begins to seep into traditional financial systems, finding a place in daily commerce.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post ‘Whale’ Moves 48,000 Bitcoin for 4 Cents in Fees As Scaling Solutions Develop appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/whale-moves-48000-bitcoin-for-4-cents-in-fees-as-scaling-solutions-develop/	2018-06-28 19:00:38+00	0

153	Blockchain Launches Institutional Platform to Give Investors Crypto Exposure	One of the largest names in the Bitcoin space, Blockchain, has announced a platform to help institutional investors get exposure to cryptocurrency. Blockchain Principal Strategies can be accessed from today and there are plans to launch additional products and services throughout the summers months.\nBlockchain Becomes Latest Company Trying to Lure Institutional Money into Crypto\nIn a blog post published earlier today, Blockchain announced the launch of Blockchain Principal Strategies (BPS). The statement read:\n“BPS provides institutions, family offices, and individual investors unparalleled and tailored access to markets, research, and services on the most trusted digital asset platform worldwide.”\nThe platform will provide access to an over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk which will allow large buy and sell orders to be performed without affecting the wider market. The team behind the desk will be comprised of professional money managers from a range of traditional financial institutions. These include Cooley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and UBS. Together, the team will provide the kind of ‘white-glove’ service that institutions are accustomed to when making sizeable investments.\nIn addition to the actual buying and selling of crypto assets, the BPS will give exclusive market insights to its clients. These will be provided by leading digital currency economist, Garrick Hileman. Hileman, an economic historian from the London School of Economics and long-time proponent of cryptocurrency, recently spoke of the virtues of Bitcoin when buying expensive items such as art, real estate, and vehicles.\nThe blog post published earlier today also mentions that users will have early access to initial coin offerings (ICOs), as well as direct investments into various companies associated with the ever-growing digital currency space.\nThe CEO and co-founder of Blockchain, Peter Smith, stated the following about the launch of the BPS:\n“We are thrilled to debut Blockchain Principal Strategies, an institutional grade platform customised for institutions, family offices, and individual investors… BPS provides clients the opportunity to invest in digital assets with the same peace of mind and security that has become synonymous with the Blockchain name.”\nThe platform was originally launched in 2011 by Nicolas Cary and Peter Smith. The Luxembourg-based company provides information about the Bitcoin blockchain and wider economy, along with resources for developers. The firm’s original website, blockchain.info was the most visited cryptocurrency-related website in 2013. However, the company has recently changed domains. They can now be found at Blockchain.com.\nThis move to appeal to institutional investors is the latest such effort from players within the cryptocurrency industry. Earlier this year, NewsBTC reported on Coinbase launching their own platform tailored to the much lauded investor class. Circle have also created a service known as ‘CircleTrade’ that is designed to provide a secure and simple entry point for institutions wishing to gain exposure to cryptocurrency.\nIt is believed by some analysts that the lack of suitable infrastructure is one of the largest obstacles stopping institutions taking up positions in cryptocurrency at present. Such moves by Blockchain and others are a clear effort to change this.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Blockchain Launches Institutional Platform to Give Investors Crypto Exposure appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/blockchain-launches-institutional-platform-to-give-investors-crypto-exposure/	2018-06-28 20:00:03+00	4

156	Line Messaging App Announces Crypto Exchange for Worldwide Consumers	Line, popular Asia-based messaging app, has confirmed the upcoming launch of its own cryptocurrency exchange, named BitBox.\nBitBox Exchange to Open in July 2018\nLine, a social media app with over 200 million users, has confirmed that it plans to open up a Singapore-based exchange, BitBox, during July.\nFor the time being, the exchange will offer the trading of thirty cryptocurrencies at a 0.1% fee, with the press release only mentioning the largest cryptocurrencies offered. These being Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin, which should go without saying.\nIt is highly speculated that Line chose Singapore as its base of operations due to the crypto-friendly sentiment held in the Asian city-state. Despite friendly regulatory sentiment, the press release mentioned that the exchange will not support fiat to cryptocurrency trading, and will only support crypto to crypto exchanges. \nDue to the fact that BitBox will not support a fiat on-ramp, the exchange will be open globally, offering its services to consumers in all countries but Japan and the U.S.\n\nThe social media company was unable to secure the proper licensing to offer exchange services in Japan, as the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) has been imposing harsher regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges. After the $550 million hack of the now notorious Coincheck exchange, the FSA reasoned that it would be logical to impose stricter rules, ensuring that a hack wouldn’t occur again.  \nBy excluding Japan from BitBox’s area of operation, Line misses out on a large percentage of its customer base, as Line has become the messaging app of choice in Japan. \nGrowing Need for Cryptocurrency Infrastructure, Does Line Fill the Gap?\nThe introduction of a cryptocurrency exchange to Line’s lineup of services was welcomed by many, as the technology company wishes to expand to new sectors. The opening of BitBox will also allow for Line to stand out in the crowd of messaging platforms, offering a unique service for its 200 million users.\nThe release noted:\n“With the need to trade cryptocurrencies rising around the world, LINE has been preparing to provide opportunities for users to do so securely, and as the secure system is in place now, the company will be offering the service.”\nThere is currently a large gap in the industry for mobile cryptocurrency trading, as Binance has slowed development on its mobile app. The press materials, including a picture of the proposed exchange platform, has shown a minimalistic cryptocurrency trading app that sports many features that a fully-fledged exchange should offer. Hopefully, BitBox will be able to fill the growing need for on the go cryptocurrency trading.\nHowever, some users were disappointed to see that BitBox would not be supporting a fiat on-ramp, as regulators have been increasing regulatory requirements for exchanges all across the world. Line probably does not have access to proper licensing and financial services that would allow it to accept and transact government-issued currencies for cryptocurrencies.\nDespite this setback, the social media company still hopes to make an impact in the growing cryptocurrency industry, with the aforementioned release stating:\n“LINE will continue to transform all users’ financial experience by providing friendly and innovative financial services to close the distance between people and money. As the society heads toward cashless and wallet-less future, LINE will be actively involved in undertaking initiatives and creating systems to accelerate the development of its businesses and reinforce its services as it strives to become a leader in the FinTech business.”\nThe world has its eyes fixed upon Line, as many await the arrival of the BitBox cryptocurrency exchange.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Line Messaging App Announces Crypto Exchange for Worldwide Consumers appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/line-messaging-app-announces-crypto-exchange-for-worldwide-consumers/	2018-06-28 22:00:25+00	2

158	Indian Crypto Exchange Asks Users to Withdraw Funds Before July 5	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided, in a circular issued on April 6, that banks in the country will no longer be allowed to do business with crypto exchanges. The deadline, which expires on July 5, is forcing companies to prepare for the worst. Zebpay, one of the largest digital currency operators in India, has even asked its customers to withdraw their funds before the deadline ends.\nCryptocurrency Exchange Asks Users to Withdraw Funds as RBI Deadline Looms\nAs the RBI deadline looms, industry players within the crypto-space are drawing up contingency plans including moving overseas.\nOthers may soon be switching to over-the-counter (OTC) trading in order to bypass the ban over centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and potentially resulting in more Bitcoin trading in the country. In the future, we will see decentralized protocols take over and put the issue to rest.\nAs digital currency operators like Zebpay ask users to withdraw their funds, many traders on these exchanges are unwilling to liquidate their holdings just yet as they wait for the market to move up again. With the deadline set for July 5, there are not many alternatives. Zebpay has stated that, while the matter is being challenged in the court, it may be incapable of transferring funds back to its users after the deadline if banks discontinue the services.\n“While our industry is challenging this legally, the outcome is beyond our control. Hence, if you are holding any rupees, or depositing any rupees in Zebpay, there could soon come a time when we may not be able to honour withdrawal requests. Please continue only if you understand this risk.”\nRupee deposits and withdrawals are at risk if the deadline goes through and banks shut down their services to cryptocurrency exchanges. “This can cause discontinuation of crypto trade based on rupees, or at least cause significant price movements,” said the company, who recommended users to make their withdrawal requests while banks still support them.\nThe rbi put forward a circular on April 6 that prohibited regulated financial entities from supporting risks associated with cryptocurrencies. The reasoning behind the central bank’s decision is that a large cryptocurrency ecosystem in India could endanger financial stability, according to RBI Deputy Governor BP Kanungo.\nThe threat centralized cryptocurrency exchanges face in India, however, is an opportunity for peer-to-peer operators. Given that neither the RBI nor the Indian government fully banned cryptocurrencies, decentralized exchanges, and peer-to-peer platforms are able to completely bypass the traditional financial system.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Indian Crypto Exchange Asks Users to Withdraw Funds Before July 5 appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/28/indian-crypto-exchange-asks-users-to-withdraw-funds-before-july-5/	2018-06-28 23:00:26+00	4

162	Dan Larimer: “Wise men plan for civilized dispute resolution before it happens” :EOS, Litecoin, Stellar Lumens, Tron and IOTA Technical Analysis	Although we are yet to see confirmations, the fact that most alt coin prices as Litecoin, IOTA, EOS and to some degree Stellar Lumens are stable and trading within tight ranges means bear pressure is slowing down.\nWell, it may be a coincidence because this week marks the end of bearish June where pull backs are common. We shall nonetheless take the optimistic approach waiting for prices to edge past key resistance line forming a spring board for further gains in the second half of the year.\nLet’s have a look at these charts:\nEOS Technical Analysis\nEOS Daily Chart by Trading View\nAt long last, the confusion, criticism and “centralization” calls are subsiding all thanks to a decision made by Dan Larimer, the CTO of EOS. One thing should be clear: that EOS is a unique blockchain project and the first that has WET governance in place. This means, there are elements of arbitration and that gave birth to ECAF.\nECAF actions which many claim were all over the place and to some extent unprofessional more so when they issued a directive freezing 27 accounts is about to be clipped. In fact Dan Larimer, while suggesting that the constitution be rechecked because “ECAF action damage to community from ECAF is greater than funds we hope to restore to users” and that “Arbitration should be limited to correction of intent of code” were the basis of a constitution check limiting ECAF’s “undefined and unpredictable power.”\n\nWhether you use ETH, BTC, or EOS there is a community governance process which enables upgrades and transaction reversals. Whether you vote by stake or by hash power, votes are cast and decisions are made.  Wise men plan for civilized dispute resolution before it happens.\n— Daniel Larimer (@bytemaster7) June 24, 2018\n\nIt’s highly that these events are behind EOS price support. In the last day alone, EOS is up three percent and actually finding support at our intermittent support at $7. This means that while the general trend is bearish, aggressive traders can pick out bottoms and start buying at current prices with stops at $7. However, conservatives should first stay on the sidelines and wait for bulls to push prices above $9. On the reverse side, any break below $7 cancels this risky buys and ushers sellers aiming for $4.\nLitecoin (LTC) Technical Analysis\nLitecoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nCryptofuse is attempting to do something no other company has tried before: Take the blockchain offline. This by all accounts is a pretty ambitious drive but a feasible one because contrary to popular opinion, not many people have internet access.\n\nOur Mission at Cryptofuse, Inc is simple. \nWe're Revolutionizing the #Blockchain industry by offering secure offline transactions, as a service.\nA small fee is paid based on the amount of offline trades, one in, one out. \nSee what we're up to at https://t.co/J0fVlTWzDN!\n— CryptoFuse, Inc (@CryptoFuseInc) June 20, 2018\n\nSo it’s a no brainer that availing technology that enables offline transactions without causing duplication within the mainnet will help boost adoption. With that you can send Litecoin transactions, smart contracts and a lot more even in the absence of the internet all thanks to the Mesh technology which they incorporate.\nLike EOS, Litecoin bulls are rejecting lower lows and is a tad bit stable, trading above $70. There is a double bar bull reversal pattern at around the first bear target and support at $70. However, what we need to conclusively make a trading decision is a break above $90 in line with our initial trade projection. However, traders can begin buying today with tight stops at $70 with first buy targets at $110. That would entail trading the pull back on a bear trend.\nStellar Lumens (XLM) Technical Analysis\nStellar Lumens Daily Chart by Trading View\nAs we conclude the month, Stellar Lumens (XLM) prices seems to be recovering, rejecting lower lows at around April lows. Regardless, we remain caution, preferring to trade with the trend and sell on every high, the simple fact that XLM is finding support means buyers can take advantage of this pull back. Ideally, what we wish to see is an up-thrust above 20 cents if XLM buyers are in charge or break below 15 cents signaling trend continuation. Either way, risk averse traders have to wait for a potential break out and trade accordingly.\nTron (TRX) Technical Analysis\nTron Daily Chart by Trading View\nFans of porn wishing to upgrade to premium can now pay using TRX coins. The rubber stamp was sealed by Tron and Justin Sun. As this partnership reverberates across the crypto-verse, Tron Super Representative Elections is ongoing. Out of the 100 candidates, two-CryptoDiva and Skypeople– are active, validating blocks. Unlike events after EOS mainnet launch, there is sanity and super nodes aren’t blocking accounts.

Now, while our sell trades are live, our stops are at June 26 highs of 4.3 cents. If TRX appreciates, reversing those losses then I recommend exiting sells and taking longs with stops at 4 cents. There is a word of caution though. Those who want a more complete double bottoms to print should wait for prices to move above our official buy triggers at 5 cents before buying.\nIOTA (IOT) Technical Analysis\nIOTA Daily Chart by Trading View\nIn lower time frames, IOTA prices are moving within a tight trade range, a consolidation with short term buy triggers at $1.1. While sellers are technically in charge, sticking to our previous trade plan and waiting for clarity is priority. So, for those trading with the trend and anticipating sells, wait for a break below 90 cents. Otherwise, if today ends up bullish, closing above $1.1, then buy with targets at $1.3 and $1 with stops at 90 cents.\nDisclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the author and aren’t investment advice.

163	IOHK: “Cardano works for the Best Interest of the User and Ecosystem”: Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis	Charles Hoskinson is the man behind Cardano and leads the Cardano Foundation. He’s authoritative and spearheads Cardano’s development. In the spirit of interoperability, he reached out to Justin Sun of Tron. In a publicized tweet, he asked him to consider integrating Mantis, which ETC uses, instead of their code which appears to be an “Ethereum Java” fork. Even though this didn’t affect price, ADA is relatively stable and testing major support at 12 cents.\nFrom the News\nIn 10 short years, blockchain and crypto has been propelled to the mainstream. During this formative stage, there are supporters-who have their reasons- and critics who think this buzz will die off naturally. Well, yes it may or may not.\n\n.@LarsBrunjes is leading the work on incentives in #Cardano, the means of encouraging people to participate in the protocol and behave in a way that is in the best interests of all users and the system as a whole. Watch his presentation on incentives here: https://t.co/WMtu41fMVz\n— Input Output (@InputOutputHK) June 22, 2018\n\nRegardless of their stand, many argue that Cardano is here to stay. They look at Charles, the main point man and see a future where DApps would run smoothly with minimum fees, a scalable network and above all with a tinge of regulatory consideration all in Cardano.\n\nCardano uses a proof-of-stake algorithm called Ouroboros. IOHK's latest research paper in this field is Ouroboros Genesis which is a step forward in the cryptography that powers cryptocurrency systems. Watch the video by Professor Kiayias here: https://t.co/dVtT8tZqIZ\n— Cardano Community (@cardanocom) June 22, 2018\n\nSince their project announcement, Cardano takes pride in their Proof of Stake consensus algorithm that is secure and publically audited. Besides, its source code is peer reviewed and has some impressive updates as far as their wallets and source code development are concerned. That’s not all. Cardano’s team features expert engineers and blockchain influencers prioritizing the creation of an interoperable, sustainable and an efficient platform.\nEmurgo Welcomes Indonesia’s Hero Group\n\nGreat news! EMURGO announce joint venture with Indonesian companies to use #Cardano blockchain to aid supply chain management, financial &amp; energy sectors! $ADA @cardanocom @emurgo_io @CardanoStiftung https://t.co/LIq6QHRGNC\n— NinjaPool | Cardano ADA Staking Pool (@NinjaPool) June 27, 2018\n\nOn the other hand, Emurgo, a wing of Cardano that helps businesses integrate with their blockchain has announced a joint venture with some of the leading Indonesian enterprises. In a consortium led by Hero Group, Emurgo and Cardano believes they can provide efficient solutions and consequently help scale their business. In a statement, the President of Hero Group said blockchain “will change global trade, retail and financing” and “which they need to understand and be involved in its growth and expansion”.\nCardano (ADA) Technical Analysis\nWeekly Chart\nCardano (ADA) Weekly Chart by Trading View\nStill at position 6 in the liquidity table, ADA continue to struggle against sell pressure. In week over week basis, ADA is down 20 percent and might even add more assuming there is a break below 12 cents. This is the main support line as highlighted in our previous analysis.\nBecause of the speed of depreciation especially after last week’s spike in sell pressure, my recommendation-when we take a top-down approach is to stay neutral. That’s until after there are strong movements either in line with the general ADA sellers or when buyers step in to stem these bears and prevent movement below ADA’s all-time lows at 7 cents.\nDaily Chart\nCardano (ADA) Daily Chart by Trading View\nIn the last 24 hours, there has been a slowdown in ADA’s depreciation. Unlike previous days, it’s actually down a one percent but still at around 12 cents. What’s of importance us is to trade with the trend and while would have been perfect, the mere fact that we are at a key support line and near ADA’s all-time lows calls for caution.\nTechnically, we take a neutral stand but with a bearish skew but if there is a recovery and ADA prices appreciate past 17 cents, we shall tow in with the buyers and buy on dips cancelling the current bear stance.\nDisclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the author and aren’t investment advice.

As CCN reported this morning, cryptocurrency volume has tapered off significantly throughout 2018, and this lack of volume does not bode well for the prospects of a market recovery.\nThe post Newsflash: Bitcoin Price Careens Below $6,000 as Downturn Worsens appeared first on CCN	4	https://www.ccn.com/newsflash-bitcoin-price-careens-below-6000-as-downturn-worsens/	2018-06-29 00:22:37+00	1
166	“We’ll help you pay for everything with Crypto” – An Interview with Co-Founder of Crypterium	“Cryptocurrencies have become a must-have attribute of a modern person,” says Vladimir Gorbunov, co-founder of Crypterium. Yet, they don’t have much use beyond trading and investment. How can we turn cryptocurrencies into real money that you can spend in the nearest supermarket? NewsBTC spoke directly with Vladimir to get the answers. \nNewsBTC: Define Crypetrium for our readers in layman’s terms.\n\nVladimir Gorbunov: Crypterium is the first global crypto bank that enables you to spend your cryptocurrency just as quickly as cash: in the nearest supermarket, while traveling, or shopping online, whenever and wherever you want.\n \nThe purpose is crystal clear to any cryptocurrency holder who currently has pretty much no way to spend crypto in real life. Though they want to pay their bills, pay off loans and make everyday purchases with crypto, they don’t have such an opportunity at the moment. We are giving them that opportunity.\nWhy would anyone want to pay with crypto when there are cash and cards?\nFirst of all, there’s already an integral part of the economy that receives income in cryptocurrencies. There are cryptocurrency miners, service providers that accept crypto payments, from lawyers to PR agencies, etc. All those people need a way to spend their hard-earned money without going through exchange hassle and losing a substantial amount of money on the conversion.\nSecondly, crypto is convenient. It’s fast and secure, and it gives you real control over your money 24/7. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have already become, in a way, a must-have attribute of a modern person. Now, the said person is just in need of a way to efficiently use crypto.\nHow big is the audience you’re targeting?\nTo realize the depth of the problem we are solving, merely take a look at our token buyer database. It’s one of the largest in the world – we have over 400,000 registered users. It’s clear we are working on an urgent matter that concerns our audience – and that’s precisely why we have received so much support from the community. \nWe are also planning to reach billions of currently unbanked people and bring them all the advantages of the new payment systems based on crypto.\nWhat do you think keeps an average Joe away from using cryptocurrency for payments today?\nSeveral obstacles are ranging from market volatility and the current decrease in cryptocurrencies’ value to the lack of comprehensible legal ways of buying crypto. Today, potential crypto buyers often have to turn to shady marketplaces or exchange outlets that have enormous fees of 10 – 25%. Add to it the vast amount of theft and fraud, and you’ll see why people hesitate to get into crypto. In a way, the crypto world today is the “Wild West.”\nHow your solution is overcoming those obstacles?\nFor starters, we are going to provide the most convenient and efficient way to purchase cryptocurrencies. Crypterium App is going to offer a simple and cheap solution of buying crypto right from your bank card anywhere in the world with minimal fees. We are planning to bring these solutions to life as early as this year. And then you’ll be able to shop with this cryptocurrencies while merchants will still be able to get fiat. So we’ll manage the whole range of fiat to crypto and crypto to fiat operations. \nYou mentioned reaching unbanked people with your solution. Why do you think they need cryptocurrency, and how will they buy it, if they don’t have cards?\nYou are right, countries like Cuba and specific regions across Asia and Africa currently have no payment terminals and no infrastructure. However, that doesn’t mean the citizens of those countries do not need to transfer funds, including international payments, or have a universal payment solution when traveling abroad.\nWe will enable them to purchase crypto for cash at particular outlets or Crypterium terminals that we are going to set worldwide. We are preparing a whole array of solutions for that: integrating with PoS terminals, establishing partnerships with many payment terminal networks, etc.\nOnce a user gets their preferred cryptocurrency on their Crypterium account, they can transfer it through Crypterium App to any recipient – even to those who don’t have a bank account but owns a smartphone. That’s the next-generation payment experience, and we are going to have it in place within 12 – 18 months.\n“The critical word is execution.”\nThere are already several projects out there that have proposed to make digital currencies more spendable like cash. How is Crypterium any different from any of them?\nFirst of all, most of the companies that claim they would provide the solution don’t have anything to offer yet. Our R&amp;D department has analyzed more than 80 companies that have offered some crypto-fiat payment solution, and it turns out that only 3 or 4 of them have launched an actual product. So here’s the first part: in the crypto economy, the critical word for any project is, Execution.\nWhy do you think Crypterium can execute its payment solutions better than other companies?\nOur main advantage is our team with vast experience in building and implementing FinTech solutions. We know this industry like the back of our hand: we know how to establish partnerships, we have worked with contactless payments, we have seen it all.\nLook at our CEO Marc O’Brien, who previously held the position of CEO of Visa UK for six years. Crypterium founders have built dozens of successful ventures with a particular focus on simplifying real-world issues through technology. Crypterium is supported by legendary entrepreneurs, like co-founder of TechCrunch Keith Teare. This stellar team is capable of achieving the most important goal: building the best product with the best functionality.\nHow’s Crypterium functionality different from other crypto payment solutions?\nWe aren’t just creating a payment solution. Instead, we are building up a whole ecosystem that will cater to the needs of any cryptocurrency holder. In addition to buying crypto and making payments with it, we are going to introduce crypto loans along with investment scenarios. We are also putting much effort into the development and expansion of our partnership network.\nTerminal networks, QR payment solutions and everything else we are developing – these are the steps we are taking towards Crypterium’s ultimate goal to make a smartphone the only thing needed for a complete banking experience. \n“We burn our tokens, but we’ll never run out of them.”\nTell us about your cryptocurrency. Is there even a need to develop another cryptocurrency? If so, what purpose does it serve?\nJust as a machine operates on fuel, Crypterium payment solutions are powered by CRPT tokens. You can compare it to “gas” powering the transactions on Ethereum. Every time someone makes a payment, a fee equal to 0.5% of the value of the trade in CRPT is taken from user’s account and burned. That’s our token economy: the smart contract controls the whole process.\nWhat happens when you burn them all?\nThe number of tokens will reduce over time, but it’s practically impossible to burn all of them. It’s just simple logic: per the laws of economics, increasing demand for tokens will raise their price, thereby reducing the amount that is going to be burned for each transaction.\nHere’s an example: if you pay for a $100 plane ticket with Crypterium App, when CRPT is worth $0.5, you’d burn one token. But if the CRPT price increases, for example to $2, you’d only need to burn 0.25 CRPT for the same transaction. Simply put, the token-burning rate will be continually decreasing. Think of it as an asymptote graph. Moreover, CRPT token is not an integer and has 18 digits after the decimal point.\nCRPT is currently listed on two exchanges. Do you have plans to add more this year?\nWe are planning to boost the number of listings next year, introducing a new one almost every month. As for 2018, we are planning to get listed on 3-4 new exchanges by the end of the year.\nEven now, CRPT trading volumes are going up. It’s great to know that our token isn’t falling below the market price, and it is ahead of the market during upswing periods.\n“We’re establishing hundreds of partnerships.”\nMerchant adoption, in general, has been very slow. There are still limitations like slow transaction confirmation. How does Crypterium fare when it comes to making instant PoS payments like Visa or MasterCard? If you do offer instant payments, how do you achieve such scalability in a crypto-environment?\nOne of the main advantages of Crypterium ecosystem is its enormous internal processing capability. Our servers can process up to 1 million transactions per minute, and we can do most of the processing within our system and not on the blockchain itself. This way, the speed of transactions within our system is virtually limitless.\nWe’ve read there are many traditional payment gateways you are trying to tap with Crypterium – like Apple Pay, for instance. Is it even possible seeing that all these centralized entities have endless terms and conditions? How do you explain a possible relationship between a crypto solution and a service like Apple or Android Pay?\nThere are two ways to get access to Apple Pay and Android Pay. We can do it on our own or through third-party partnerships. In the first scenario, once we obtain our E-Money license, we can quickly apply and connect to Apple Pay and Android Pay. We’ve already got the experience and technologies to do that. The downside is that obtaining this license can take a considerable amount of time.\nIn the second case, we’ll turn to our partners, 70% of which are already connected to Apple Pay and Android Pay. This way, the first version of our solution will be based on our existing partnerships.\nHow do you persuade companies like Visa or MasterCard to work with you?\nWe have a lot of critical potential partners on our radar, including but not limited to significant payment providers such as Visa, MasterCard, and UnionPay. We are in talks with some cardless payment infrastructures. We are developing IBAN payments and looking for any other improvements we can make.\nCrypterium will establish hundreds of partnerships and integrations; of course, Visa and MasterCard are likely to be there at some point. But once again, we are not prioritizing any potential partner right now.\nDifferent countries have different laws and regulations: how long will it take Crypterium to create a truly global solution?\nCrypterium consists of two essential parts: the crypto part and the fiat part. We are unique in that we completely separate the two elements from each other. The fiat part essentially has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies: for instance, a merchant receives fiat money even though the payment was made in crypto. It means we are going through all the regulatory procedures and meeting all the requirements for a traditional bank. We are planning to settle all regulatory issues in the critical regions by the end of this year.\n Also, some countries don’t require us to obtain a license; we’ll launch there sooner. Marc O’Brien, our CEO, is a world-class specialist with massive experience in banking and payment systems; he will surely be instrumental in dealing with any regulatory disparities across the globe.\nWhat are the critical markets for Crypterium?\nEurope, the USA, and Asia are the top priority regions for us, followed by Brazil and Australia. Next are other countries where we are opening offices and working with regulators. Russia isn’t omitted either, even though it’s not at the top of the list: we’ve got a partner bank here and are ready to implement bill payments and transfers.\nA hypothetical question: what if the demand of CRPT token drops, say, in front of another solution? Is there any backup plan?\nThe cryptomarket is comprised of hundreds of millions of people. One competing solution won’t change anything: after all, today’s society doesn’t have an exclusive social medium, an exclusive taxi service or an exclusive bank, so why would Crypterium be exclusive? Once again, it comes down to execution, not to the idea itself. Among the quantity and quality of services, well-thought tariff strategy, and product scalability, Crypterium has all the chances to seize and retain market leadership.\nThe post “We’ll help you pay for everything with Crypto” – An Interview with Co-Founder of Crypterium appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/well-help-you-pay-for-everything-with-crypto-an-interview-with-co-founder-of-crypterium/	2018-06-29 00:39:17+00	0

169	Facebook To Acquire Coinbase?	A sensational new rumor has been making the rounds lately – that Facebook, the social media behemoth, is eyeing an acquisition of Coinbase, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchange platforms.\nA potential acquisition would have dramatic effects on the general adoption and awareness of cryptocurrencies. Although Facebook is still reeling from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it is still the world’s biggest social network with more than 2 billion active users each month.\nAs such, this rumor could easily be chalked up to wishful thinking or speculation gone awry. However, there’s actually more substance to it than one might initially assume. First and foremost, reports of a possible Facebook acquisition of Coinbase have first lifted in an article The Economist ran in early June.\nWhat’s more, Facebook has just recently lifted its ban on cryptocurrency and ICO advertisements. This change in course comes after the social media network previously banned cryptocurrency advertisements this January, which Twitter and Google would later do as well.\nTherefore, it came as somewhat of a surprise when Facebook recently announced that it would reverse its stance on cryptocurrency advertisements. \nWhilst some previously argued that this reversal was motivated by Facebook being reluctant to forgo the massive market that is cryptocurrency advertising, some are now speculating that this more cryptocurrency-friendly policy could be linked to a possible Coinbase purchase.\nMoreover, Facebook has recently undertaken a major management reshuffle, which also involved the launch of a blockchain technology division. This division would reportedly look at\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Facebook To Acquire Coinbase? appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/facebook-to-acquire-coinbase/	2018-06-29 01:42:49+00	0

171	Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Another Day, Another Breakdown	Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price was previously consolidating in an ascending triangle pattern before breaking lower.\nThis suggests that further losses are in the cards, especially as a small bearish flag is forming.\nTechnical indicators signals are reflecting a slowdown in bearish momentum, though.\n\nBitcoin price could be in for more losses as it broke below the ascending triangle, but technical indicators say otherwise.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside. In other words, the selloff is more likely to carry on than to reverse. The 100 SMA is also close to the broken triangle support to add to its strength as resistance in a pullback.\nHowever, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to signal slowing bearish pressure. This could even be followed by an upward crossover which might draw buyers back in.\nAlso, RSI is indicating oversold conditions or that sellers are exhausted. Turning higher could bring bullish pressure back in and lead to a retest of the broken triangle bottom around $6,100. Similarly stochastic is in the oversold region to show that sellers might take it easy and let buyers take over.\nStill, it’s worth noting that the triangle pattern spans $5,800 to $6,250 so the resulting selloff could be of the same height. A small bearish flag can also be seen to signal likely continuation.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nBitcoin has had a pretty rough week as regulatory jitters have returned and risk appetite has been subdued. Last week, Japan’s FSA stepped up its restrictions on exchanges related to AML and KYC checks and South Korea’s regulators appear to be following suit.\nIn the US, the DOJ has reportedly arrested 35 criminals by posing undercover in the darknet. Further arrests are expected, leading traders to stay cautious and be quick about booking profits.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Another Day, Another Breakdown appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/bitcoin-btc-price-watch-another-day-another-breakdown/	2018-06-29 03:57:21+00	1

173	Tron (TRX) Price Watch: Bulls Shrug Off Mainnet Launch	Tron Price Key Highlights\n\nTron was previously consolidating inside a descending triangle as it formed lower highs and found support at 0.38.\nPrice is now breaking through support to indicate that further losses are in the cards.\nThe highly-anticipated mainnet launch didn’t seem to have much of an impact on price as expected.\n\nTron could be poised for more losses as it breaks below the descending triangle bottom on the 4-hour time frame.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200  SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. In addition, the 100 SMA lines up with the top of the triangle to add to its strength as a ceiling around 0.042.\nRSI is on the move down to reflect the presence of selling pressure, but the oscillator is closing in on the oversold region. Stochastic is also moving south so Tron could follow suit until oversold conditions are indicated. Turning higher could lead to a pullback to the broken triangle bottom or a bounce back inside the formation.\nNote that the chart pattern spans 0.038 to 0.058 so the resulting drop could be of the same height.\nTRXUSD Chart from TradingView\nTron had its Independence Day early in the week as it activated its mainnet following a migration to its independent public blockchain, following the beta launch at the end of May.\nAccording to the company’s blog post, the foundation handed out “a small number of TRX during the 12-hr livestream so the members of the TRON community could test the different features of TRON mainnet.”\nIt also explained that:\nTron Independent Group (TIG) is a community consensus-based group, consisting 27 anonymous, volunteering Genesis Representatives (GR).

186	‘Wolf of Wall Street’ Jordan Belfort States that the Bitcoin Market Has ‘Run out of Fools’	Jordan Belfort, popularly known as the real-life ”Wolf of Wall Street”, has previously proved that he is not afraid to make controversial statements. He’s at it again yesterday, stating in a new video that the current cryptocurrency market sentiment is “the beginning of the end” for Bitcoin.\nMore specifically, Belfort refers to a ”greater fools theory” in his video, this being an investment theory hypothesizing that the price of any security can be justified if a rational buyer is ”foolish” enough to believe that another party might pay a higher price for it, regardless of its intrinsic value.\nBelfort also compared the current market sentiment in relation to Bitcoin prices to the Great Recession of 2008, where investors could not find willing buyers for defunct portage-backed securities – something he argued could now transpire with Bitcoin.\nPut simply, Belfort argues that the current Bitcoin price is inflated due to ”foolish” market behavior. Belfort also urged investors to exit the cryptocurrency market, as investors could ”lose all their money” as the market runs out of ”fools” – which Belfort said is happening. \nBelfort is not the first institutional investor to show reluctance to Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector as a whole. The epitome of Wall Street, legendary billionaire Warren Buffet, famously referred to Bitcoin as ”rat poison squared” earlier this year.\nNonetheless, Belfort stated that he was a believer in the underlying blockchain technology. However, whilst he acknowledged that there are indeed use-cases for the blockchain technology, he also said that those investing in Bitcoin should ”get out” of the market as soon as possible.\nBelfort joins other cryptocurrency non-believers who question the cryptocurrencies but accept the practicality of blockchain technology. Jack Ma, co-founder of Alibaba, has famously echoed this sentiment in the past – praising blockchain technology whilst denouncing Bitcoin.\nAlthough these comments could naturally be Belfort’s honest opinion, they could also be seen as an effort to spread FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) amongst investors. FUD is an important factor in all investing, as prices largely depend on the sentiment of buyers.\nMoreover, some have proposed that this is mainly a bid for Belfort to ”remain relevant” by offering his take on one of the most hotly debated topics in the world. \nBelfort has previously made his negative stance in relation to cryptocurrencies known, stating that Bitcoin is ”a fraud” and that ICOs could be regarded as ”the biggest scam ever”. It doesn’t take a genius to discern that Belfort may not be entirely neutral in his comments – although they will be sure to make headlines.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ Jordan Belfort States that the Bitcoin Market Has ‘Run out of Fools’ appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/wolf-of-wall-street-jordan-belfort-states-that-the-bitcoin-market-has-run-out-of-fools/	2018-06-29 08:14:34+00	1
174	Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Resumes Its Slide	Key Points\n·         Bitcoin cash price declined further and moved to a new monthly low at $650 against the US Dollar.\n·         There is a new connecting bearish trend line formed with resistance near $690 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\n·         The pair is likely to extend losses towards the $640 and $630 levels in the near term.\nBitcoin cash price is back in a downtrend below $700 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD may perhaps continue to decline towards the $630 level if sellers remain in action.\nBitcoin Cash Price Resistance\nThere was a fresh downside wave initiated from the $780 swing high in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The BCH/USD pair failed to gain traction, moved down, and broke a few important supports such as $750 and $700. The decline was such that the price even broken the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $665 swing low to $780 high.\nIt resulted in more losses below the $665 swing low and the price traded to a new low near $650. It seems like the price may continue to move down towards the $640 and $630 levels. The next target could be the 1.236 fib extension level of the last leg from the $665 swing low to $780 high. Further below this, the price may even test the $620 support zone. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $680 level. There is also a new connecting bearish trend line formed with resistance near $690 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price remains in a major downtrend below $700. If there is no recovery sooner or later, the price may even test the $600 handle.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is now near the oversold levels.\nMajor Support Level – $630\nMajor Resistance Level – $690\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Resumes Its Slide appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/bitcoin-cash-price-analysis-bch-usd-resumes-its-slide/	2018-06-29 04:08:15+00	2

177	Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH/USD Could Decline Further	Key Highlights\n\nETH price extended its decline and traded to a new weekly low at $415.54 against the US Dollar.\nThere is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $435 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\nThe pair is in a bearish zone and it could extend its decline towards the $405-410 levels in the near term.\n\nEthereum price is struggling to recover against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ETH/USD may perhaps decline further below the $415 low if buyers continue to struggle.\nEthereum Price Upside Hurdle\nThere was a rejection noted around the $446 level in ETH price against the US Dollar. The ETH/USD pair failed to break resistance and declined back below $430. There was a break below the $425 and $420 support levels. As a result, there was a new low formed at $415.54 and the price is currently in a bearish zone. An initial resistance is around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $450 high to $415 low.\nIf there is a break above $423, the price could extend gains towards the $430 level. On the upside, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $435 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The same trend line is positioned with the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $450 high to $415 low. Therefore, the price is likely to face a strong resistance near the $430-435 zone. A break above this could push the price towards the $445 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price is clearly under a lot of pressure below $430. It may perhaps continue to move down towards the $410 level. On the upside, resistances are at $430, $435 and $445.\nHourly MACD – The MACD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI – The RSI is now well below the 40 level.\nMajor Support Level – $410\nMajor Resistance Level – $435\nThe post Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH/USD Could Decline Further appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-usd-could-decline-further/	2018-06-29 05:00:51+00	0
178	A New Yearly Low Looms as Crypto Markets Continue Bleeding	FOMO Moments\nCrypto land is in pain; Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Cardano and Monero are all hurting.\nThe downward pressure has continued as the week draws to a close with markets plummeting further again today. After lulling just below $250 billion for a couple of days crypto markets have taken another turn south dropping below $240 billion and heading towards a new yearly low.\nThat $5k Bitcoin prediction is looking more likely as BTC once again drops below $6k, falling 3.7% on the day to $5,890. Ethereum has shadowed it with a 3% fall to just over $420 during Asian trading. As usual all altcoins have been bashed again with only two showing any gains in the top 50.\n\nTaking the biggest hit in the top ten at the moment is Bitcoin Cash dropping 6.7% over the past 24 hours to $660. BCH did fall further to just over $600 during the first week of April. Cardano is another big loser today with a 6.2% decline to $0.117, its lowest level since the end of November. EOS, Litecoin, Stellar and Iota have all lost over 5% on the day as markets plummet back towards last Sunday’s dip.\nMonero in twelfth place is also not looking pretty with a 10.5% fall to $117 also taking this altcoin back to mid-November price levels. Neo, Ontology, Qtum, Icon, Lisk and Zilliqa are all getting trounced at the time of writing losing between 7 and 8 percent on the day. Other double figure declines at the moment include Decred down 10%, Bitcoin Diamond falling 13%, KuCoin Shares losing 14% and Komodo with a 12% drop.\nBinance Coin is currently holding up with a 2.3% gain on the day to $14.24. Over the week however BNB has lost 14.5% from $16.65 this time last Friday. Augur down in 30th place is also pumping at the moment, up 8% to just over $32. Mainnet launches are often the reason for buying pressure however this has not been the case for EOS and Tron which have both lost ground following their much hyped mainnet launches.\nA couple of the more obscure altcoins are also bucking the trend and performing well at the moment. Mithril is on a pump, up 18% to $0.437 as is Ethos climbing 16% to $1.34. All others are in the red though as markets inch dangerously closer to another 2018 dip. At the moment total market capitalization is just below $236 billion, down 4% or $10 billion, from $246 billion this time yesterday. Since last Friday crypto markets have lost 46 billion dollars, 16% down from $282 billion. A new low is imminent and Bitcoin could well fall to $5,000 within the next few days.\nFOMO Moments is a section that takes a daily look at the top 25 altcoins during the Asian trading session and analyses the best performing one, looking for trends and possible fundamentals.\nThe post A New Yearly Low Looms as Crypto Markets Continue Bleeding appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/a-new-yearly-low-looms-as-crypto-markets-continue-bleeding/	2018-06-29 05:04:55+00	1

180	CryptoKitties Team To Join Ubisoft at Blockchain Heroes Hackathon	Benny Giang tweeted out to his followers on the CryptoKitties twitter feed that his team would be joining Ubisoft this week in Paris for a special hackathon. To mark the collaboration he posted an image of a special edition “Rabbid Kitty” and ended the tweet by writing “Super excited about more official collabs coming out soon“. The tease worked, as commenters speculate over what other collaborations may be coming.\n\nCK x Ubisoft  pic.twitter.com/f11w5cxLui\n— Benny (@BennyGiang) June 28, 2018\n\nThe special hackathon mentioned in the tweet is the Ubisoft organized Blockchain Heroes which will be taking place from June 29 -July 1 in Montreuil, France. The object of the hackathon is to challenge development teams to integrate blockchain technology with gaming, so it’s no mystery why Ubisoft founder and CEO Yves Guillemot wanted the CryptoKitties team to be apart of the program.\nSince it’s introduction in late 2017 CryptoKitties has become the worlds most successful blockchain-based game. Having transacted US $25 million via 1,5 million wallets the kitty based game introduced a mass consumer audience to blockchain technology and demonstrated real-world value for digital assets. There is no doubt that blockchain will be the next platform for interactive gaming and that the development of games will push the mainstream adaption of blockchain the way email brought the masses to the internet.\nAs Rohan Gharegozlou, CEO of CryptKitties said about games bringing mainstream users to new technology, “From Doom on PC to Farmville and Facebook, games have been key in driving mainstream consumer adoption of emerging platforms, and blockchain will be no different, but blockchain unlocks exciting new possibilities for developers and players alike. Players can truly own their digital items and developers can create all sorts of new experiences.”\nBlockchain Heroes Hackathon\nUbisoft as a major creator, publisher, and distributor of interactive games like the Assasins Creed series recognizes the potential of blockchain based gaming, which is why they put together the Blockchain Hereos hackathon to encourage developers to build on existing decentralized apps. In a way, they are following CryptoKitties lead as they recently revealed a program to support developers working on third-party projects by providing funding, free tools, and guidance.\nNicolas Pouard, Blockchain Initiative Manager at Ubisoft was quoted about his expectations of the hackathon saying:\n“We truly believe in blockchain’s potential to provide key new benefits to players that could help improve their gaming experience. This hackathon is an opportunity to explore how to set them as heroes of our worlds like never before,”\nBy the way, that special edition Rabbid Kitty will be awarded to the top team by CEO Gharegozlou and though no monetary value has been set on it, similar custom Kitties have sold for over $100,000 in the past.\nThe post CryptoKitties Team To Join Ubisoft at Blockchain Heroes Hackathon appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/cryptokitties-team-to-join-ubisoft-at-blockchain-heroes-hackathon/	2018-06-29 06:00:00+00	0
181	Ripple Price Analysis: XRP/USD Targets Fresh Lows	Key Highlights\n\nRipple price failed to move above the $0.4750 resistance and declined against the US dollar.\nThere is a major bearish trend line in place with resistance near $0.4600 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).\nThe pair could accelerate declines below $0.4300 and it may even trade to a new low in the near term.\n\nRipple price is facing a heavy selling interest against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. XRP/USD is likely to decline further below the $0.4300 and $0.4200 levels.\nRipple Price Support\nYesterday, there was a minor upside correction above the $0.4600 level in Ripple price against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair even traded above the $0.4700 level. However, the upside move was capped by the $0.4750 resistance. The price was rejected, resulting in a downside reaction below the $0.4600 level. It even broke the $0.4500 and $0.4400 support levels.\nA low was formed at $0.4393 and it seems like there could be more losses in the near term. An initial resistance is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $0.4572 high to $0.4393 low. However, the most important resistance is near the $0.4600 level. There is also a major bearish trend line in place with resistance near $0.4600 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $0.4572 high to $0.4393 low is below the trend line to prevent gains. Therefore, if the price corrects higher, it is likely to face sellers near the $0.4600 and $0.4620 levels.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price remains at a risk of more declines below the $0.4400 level. The next supports are seen near the $0.4320 and $0.4200 levels.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is placed heavily in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now well below the 35 level.\nMajor Support Level – $0.4350\nMajor Resistance Level – $0.4600\nThe post Ripple Price Analysis: XRP/USD Targets Fresh Lows appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/ripple-price-analysis-xrp-usd-targets-fresh-lows/	2018-06-29 06:30:27+00	0

183	Bitcoin Falls to a Yearly Low of $5,800: Factors and Trends	The Bitcoin bloodbath of 2018 continues as the leading cryptocurrency fell to a new yearly low of $5,885.41 and still descending. Marking an almost 50% price drop this quarter and down nearly 75% from its all-time high just 6 months ago.\nPundits, bulls, and bears all have their own theories on the factors that control the market.  The market is volatile, crypto traders are emotional and the bubble is bursting are all ad-hoc fallbacks that supposed financial oracles rely on, but there are also real-world factors that have been laying Bitcoin low throughout the year.\nMt. Gox\nThe shadow of the now legendary Mt. Gox hack and all of the FUD that followed it continued to bloody the market waters this year as massive sell-offs of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash by the estate’s trustee was revealed. Over the course of a few months, roughly 36,000 Bitcoin and 34,000 Bitcoin Cash were dumped, possibly causing the market to bottom out at $6,000 in February. Furious traders took to social media speculating that the market was being manipulated with Bitcoin essentially stolen from users.\nThere’s been no shortage of attacks on exchanges so far in 2018, each causing price dips of their own relative to the size and severity of the hack. Starting just after the new year when Japanese exchange Coincheck was taken for a jaw-dropping $534 million worth of the NEM token. Though the effects of the hack were felt throughout the space,  a quick announcement by Coincheck that they intended to reimburse customers softened the initial blow.\nThe Coincheck hack trained the focus of regulatory bodies around the world on the weak security responsible for the hack but that didn’t stop blackhats from siphoning off more digital assets. Since January there have been at least four other major hacks; the latest just weeks ago on South Korea’s largest crypto exchange Bithumb.\nThe overall market effects of the Bithumb were fairly negligible, partly due to the exchanges quick response and following Coincheck’s example promising to pay back the $30 million that was stolen back to its customers.  Also possibly partly due to people realizing that as Charlie Lee, the founder of litecoin,  put it on CNBC:\n“It’s like if a bank gets broken in and gold gets stolen, does this affect the price of gold?”\nCapital Gains Tax\nCrypto Bull Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Associates floated the theory that the steep decline in Bitcoin price at the early part of the year was an effect of newly minted Bitcoin millionaires selling off coin to pay their $25 billion crypto asset tax bill. He suggested that once the April, 15 tax deadline passed Bitcoin would start to gain traction.  Which it did for a short time, going from about 8,500 at tax time to nearly $10,000 before dropping back to security at $8,000 by mid- May.\nThese and a myriad of other factors have been beating Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market for the last six months. Call them growing pains, but the upside is that Bitcoin has continued to rally back from its lows. Not to the levels that the Fast Money bulls have predicted but enough to prove that Bitcoin is a very difficult bubble to burst.\nThe post Bitcoin Falls to a Yearly Low of $5,800: Factors and Trends appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/bitcoin-falls-to-a-yearly-low-of-5800-factors-and-trends/	2018-06-29 07:00:04+00	0

185	Cardano Price Analysis: ADA/USD Could Test $0.1100	Key Highlights\n\nADA price is under heavy pressure and is currently trading well below $0.1300 against the US Dollar (tethered).\nThere is a crucial bearish trend line formed with resistance at $0.1210 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data feed via Bittrex).\nThe pair is likely to continue its downside move towards the $0.1100 support level in the near term.\n\nCardano price extended its slide against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ADA/USD remains at a risk of more losses towards the $0.1100 and $0.1000 levels.\nCardano Price Analysis\nThere was a minor upside move above the $0.1250 level recently in ADA price against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair traded towards $0.1300, but it failed to gain upside momentum. As a result, there was a downside reaction and the price declined below the $0.1200 support. The drop was such that the price traded to a new monthly low below $0.1140 and is currently trading well below the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nA low was formed at $0.1132 and the price is currently correcting higher. An initial resistance is near the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $0.1287 high to $0.1132 low. However, the most important resistance is near the $0.1210 level. There is also a crucial bearish trend line formed with resistance at $0.1210 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $0.1287 high to $0.1132 low. Therefore, any upside move from the current levels is likely to face sellers near $0.1210.\n\nThe chart indicates that the price is clearly in a major downtrend below $0.1500. More losses are likely towards the $0.1100 and $0.1000 support levels in the near term.\nHourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI – The RSI for ADA/USD is near the oversold levels with no major sign of a recovery.\nMajor Support Level – $0.1100\nMajor Resistance Level – $0.1210\nThe post Cardano Price Analysis: ADA/USD Could Test $0.1100 appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/cardano-price-analysis-ada-usd-could-test-0-1100/	2018-06-29 08:00:38+00	0
187	Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Broke Key Support	Key Points\n\nBitcoin price broke down and cleared a major support near the $6,000 level against the US Dollar.\nYesterday’s highlighted declining channel with support at $5,950 was breached on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\nThe pair is now well below the $6,000 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\n\nBitcoin price moved into a bearish zone below $6,000 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD may perhaps extend its slide towards the $5,650 level in the near term.\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nAfter trading in a key range above the $6,000 level, bitcoin price faced sellers against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair started a downside move and broke the $6,100 and $6,000 support levels. The decline was such that the price cleared the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $5,665 low to $6,338 high. It is now trading well below the $6,000 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nMore importantly, yesterday’s highlighted declining channel with support at $5,950 was breached on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair traded as low as $5,789 and it is currently correcting higher. An initial resistance is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $6,345 high to $5,789 low. However, the most important resistance is near the $6,100 level and the 100 hourly SMA. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $6,345 high to $5,789 low.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price may correct a few points in the short term towards $6,000 and $6,100. However, it is likely to face sellers above $6,000. Therefore, there are high chances of it declining further below $5,780 to test the last swing low of $5,650.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is placed in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is correcting from the oversold levels.\nMajor Support Level – $5,780\nMajor Resistance Level – $6,100\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Broke Key Support appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/bitcoin-price-watch-btc-usd-broke-key-support/	2018-06-29 08:28:21+00	3

199	Major VR Platform Raises $35 Million to Create Virtual World on EOS	Virtual reality platform High Fidelity believes that by using blockchain technology they can reach an audience of a billion people and have just raised $35 million in fresh revenue to do so.\n$35 Million Raised to Create New Virtual World\nThe series D fundraising round was led by a $2o million investment by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy EOS Ecosystem Fund and also included existing investors such as Breyer Capital, IDG Capital Partners and Vulcan Capital.\nPhilip Rosedale, the CEO of High Fidelity, and creator of the highly popular virtual world Second Life is creating a blockchain infrastructure to support a billion VR users and has already created a native cryptocurrency and digital-asset registry.\n“The High Fidelity platform is currently in beta, so it has been partly launched. The headsets that will really take us into the big consumer market are not available just yet. A lot of our early focus is on location-based facilities,” Rosedale told the New York Times.\nHigh Fidelity’s goal is to usher in the Metaverse or the universe of virtual reality worlds. Rosedale launched Second Life in 2003, which gave birth to a digital currency called Linden dollars that produced more than $4 billion globally in virtual transactions. For his new virtual world, he wants to use blockchain to create a token called High Fidelity Coin, a stable coin paired to the US dollar,  which will be needed to use the VR platform.\n“If bitcoin had been around in 2005, I would have been delighted to use it for Second Life,” Rosedale said before continuing on about High Fidelity Coin “It is not something that people would want to buy as an investment,”\nTransactions in the Virtual World Will be Registered on EOS\nWithin the virtual world, users will access digital tokens controlled by a tablet-like device to purchase goods licensed by real-world merchants.

211	Chinese Firm Detects Tether Vulnerability	Slowmist, a private Chinese digital security company, has reported of detecting a double-spending vulnerability in the code of Tether (USDT).\nIn a lengthy Twitter post, the security firm stated it was able to send USDT to an undisclosed crypto exchange by entering false field values in the transaction. This means that crypto punters, trading with USDT (which is second in 24 hour trading volume, behind only bitcoin) may be credited with tokens without actually sending them, which is a definition of a double-spend vulnerability.\nThe tweet raised a huge amount of concern within the crypto community, which has already been going through a torrid time lately, with digital currency prices dropping below their yearly lows.\nNonetheless, founder of OmniLayer, a platform on which USDT was developed explained the malfunction, saying that, “It appears that what happened here is that an exchange wasn’t checking the valid flag on transactions. They accepted a transaction with valid=false (which they should not have), and then the second “double spend” transaction had valid=true, which they also accepted. Unless I am missing something, this is just poor exchange integration.“\nOne of the leading crypto exchanges globally, OKEx, has also chimed in on the matter, claiming it immediately contacted their business partner SlowMist after being informed on the issue. A series of tests were performed to further understand the problem and luckily, one of the biggest crypto exchanges is not affected by it, which is good news for everyone, involved with digital currencies.\nIt seems the vulnerability might actually prove to be a fault of the unnamed exchange, as no other platforms reported having trouble with USDT.\nTether has been a subject of numerous controversies lately. Earlier this week, the company issued an additional $250 million worth of USDT tokens. As USDT is a stablecoin and is supposedly backed by the US dollar on a 1:1 ratio, its price remains stable, while the rest of the virtual currencies continue to slide.\nThe stablecoin was also accused of being behind the bitcoin price manipulation in 2017 and the controversy only deepened in January when Tether fired Friedman LLP, a law firm that was hired to perform on official audit on the company’s holdings and confirm whether USDT is really entirely backed by USD.\nNonetheless, some clarity has finally been provided, as another US-based law firm Freeh Sporkin and Sullivan LLP confirmed that Tether‘s USD reserves and USDT tokens in circulation are equal. Even though it was not an official audit, it cleared at least some of the controversy. Amidst the recent crypto market slump, Tether benefited from its stable price and has climbed to the 9th spot on the biggest cryptocurrencies rankings, overtaking IOTA and TRON following the influx of new USDT tokens.\n \nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Chinese Firm Detects Tether Vulnerability appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/chinese-firm-detects-tether-vulnerability/	2018-06-29 15:01:00+00	0

223	Allianz Economic Advisor: Bitcoin’s Future is Mainly as a Store of Value	One of the planet’s most respected financial market analysts has spoken about a possible entry point for investors wishing to get exposure to Bitcoin, along with his thoughts about the future of the most successful digital asset to date.\nMohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, stated that the cryptocurrency was worth considering at prices below $5,000 per BTC.\n$5,000 a Bitcoin Represents a Solid Entry Point for Investors\nEl-Erian told CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box‘ on Friday that he felt prices below the $5,000 mark were to be considered as a worthy entry point for Bitcoin investors. The experienced market commentator went on to state that he feels those who believe in the future of the digital asset would provide a base upon which gains could be realised:\n“I don’t think you get all the way back to $20,000, but I do think that you need to establish a base whereby the people who really believe in the future of Bitcoin consolidate and then that provides you a lift.”\nThe Allianz adviser went on to talk about the future of Bitcoin. For him, the world’s most successful digital currency will emerge as a store of value, rather than a currency per se. However, he also didn’t rule out the possibility that some will continue to use it as a medium of exchange:\n“It will be a means of exchange… It’s not going to be a currency, it’s going to be another commodity-like asset out there that you can trade, and mainly as a store of value.”\nEl-Erian also spoke about the future of digital currencies more generally. His words indicated a belief that both the idea of virtual cash and the technology underpinning Bitcoin were here to stay:\n“I suspect that if you look 10 to 15 years down the road, we will have digital currencies but the public sector will have involvement in that. It will not be pure Bitcoin… But the blockchain technology, take that seriously.”\nAllianz is a Germany-based economic services provider. They largely focus on asset management, as well as providing insurance products. Their asset management division oversees is worth over 1,960 billion euros.\nThe last time NewsBTC reported on El-Erian was in November 2017. Last year, the 59-year-old Egyptian American stated that he felt Bitcoin was overvalued at $4,000. He also claimed that the asset was not yet mature enough to be treated as a currency. Evidently, his opinion hasn’t changed in the last seven months as he still claims that its primary role will be as a digital commodity, rather than a reliable medium of exchange.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Allianz Economic Advisor: Bitcoin’s Future is Mainly as a Store of Value appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/allianz-economic-advisor-bitcoins-future-is-mainly-as-a-store-of-value/	2018-06-29 18:00:15+00	0

226	ICOs Have Generated $13.7 Billion in 2018 So Far, Nearly Doubling 2017 Numbers	In the first five months of 2018, cryptocurrency sales from initial coin offerings (ICOs) jumped to $13.7 billion — almost double the amount raised for the whole of 2017, according to a report released yesterday by PwC’s strategy and consulting division Strategy&amp; and Switzerland-based Crypto Valley Association.\n2018’s Initial Coin Offerings\nThis year’s digital currency sales from 537 coin offerings topped last year’s total of $7 billion, and included a giant offering from Telegram. This was the encrypted messaging platform founded by Russia-born entrepreneurs Pavel and Nikolai Durov in 2013, which raised $1.7 billion in a non-public sale. The biggest token sale was for Block.one’s EOS, which raised more than $4 billion in a year-long token offering that started in the middle of last year.\n\nThe ICO report, covered by Reuters, also said that of the 3,470 ICOs announced since the first token offering in 2013, only 30% of those have closed successfully, with many being delayed or losing momentum during the process.\nAs for destinations, the United States remains a leader, hosting 56 ICOs, raising $1.1 billion in the first five months of 2018. This, according to the report, is because of ‘clear and firm regulatory requirements’ in the country. In relation, notes the report, is that ICOs are increasingly beginning to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which earlier this month clarified its position on tokens and token sales.\nFor Europe, Switzerland is the ICO capital, but in 2018, the U.K. has gained ground in terms of volume and numbers. So far it has registered 48 ICOs this year, raising $507 million. The report sheds a positive light on the local blockchain ecosystem in Switzerland, a large degree of which is concentrated around the Swiss municipality of Zug, also called Crypto Valley. \n\n“This report shows that Switzerland is still a leading hub for ICO and blockchain activity,” Oliver Bussmann, president of the Crypto Valley Association, said.\n\nSmaller jurisdictions including Malta, Liechtenstein, and Gibraltar are also following in the footsteps of Switzerland to position themselves as ICO-friendly hubs.\nIn addition, the report highlights regulatory developments surrounding ICOs globally, noting three distinctive approaches that can be used to characterize the majority of emerging frameworks: ‘securities-driven,’ ‘balanced,’ and ‘binary,’ most clearly observed in North America, Europe, and Asia, respectively.\n\n“After all the hype of 2017, this year has seen the ICO sector becoming more mature and established, with an improved focus on best business and legal practice, investor relations, and fundraising,” Daniel Diemers, head of blockchain EMEA at Strategy&amp;, said. “Hybrid models of combined venture capital and ICO financing are increasingly bringing together the best of what both have to offer, so that the soundness of a business is validated while it realises its market potential by receiving crowd support.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post ICOs Have Generated $13.7 Billion in 2018 So Far, Nearly Doubling 2017 Numbers appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/icos-have-generated-13-7-billion-in-2018-so-far-nearly-doubling-2017-numbers/	2018-06-29 19:00:34+00	0

233	Continued Success of Binance Sees First Crypto to Fiat Exchange in Uganda	Binance have announced their first cryptocurrency to fiat trading platform. It won’t be directly connected with their existing exchange platform, however. Instead, it’s being launched in the African nation of Uganda.\nBinance Uganda Launches with Promotions to Attract Users\nThe new Ugandan wing of Binance will begin accepting registrations from today. However, trading itself is being postponed to an as yet unknown date.\nThe exchange giants are also offering a couple of enticing promotional offers to lure new users to the platform. One of these is already live and rewards each of the first 20,000 users registering at Binance Uganda with 0.5 BNB coins – the native currency of the Binance exchange.\nThe second promotion will commence as soon as trading begins on the exchange. Binance are offering all those who use their Ugandan platform the opportunity to trade entirely for free with them for the entirety of the company’s first month operating.\nToday’s news comes courtesy of a blog post from the company themselves. In the post, Binance also state that their users can follow their new Ugandan platform on both Facebook and Telegram.\nThe Binance exchange was one of the biggest crypto success stories of last year. After raising $15 million in July, the company’s founder Changpeng Zhao launched the platform. It quickly became the world’s largest exchange in terms of traded value.\nThe company continues to strive for innovation, despite the current downtrend in the cryptocurrency market. They recently announced that they would be supporting three airdrops from the newly launched EOS network. This is somewhat out of character for a cryptocurrency exchange since supporting such distributions forfeits some wallet security whilst not providing direct benefit to the platform itself. However, it does highlight a firm commitment to customer satisfaction and has no doubt won them increased support from the crypto community.\nBinance also have plans to launch euro trading later in 2018 with the intention of adding more fiat currency pairs for customers too. Along with this news, the company has also relocated to crypto-friendly Malta and opened an office on the island of Jersey. These developments are part of the company’s efforts to negotiate the tricky process of achieving regulatory acceptance in Europe.\nGiven Binance’s efforts to tow the regulatory line, it seems inevitable that additional crypto to fiat trading pairs will soon be available in other parts of the world. Here’s hoping the service announced today for the digital currency traders of Uganda is the first of many such developments for the hugely successful exchange platform.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Continued Success of Binance Sees First Crypto to Fiat Exchange in Uganda appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/continued-success-of-binance-sees-first-crypto-to-fiat-exchange-in-uganda/	2018-06-29 20:00:05+00	0

264	How Line, Japan’s Biggest Messaging App, is Going All Out on Crypto	Line, the most widely utilized messaging application in Japan with over 200 million active monthly users, is attempting to establish dominance over the blockchain and crypto sector with various ventures including a cryptocurrency exchange and a decentralized application (dapp) platform.\nCrypto Exchange\nOn June 28, NewsBTC reported that Line has finalized its plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange by July of this year. Based in Singapore, BitBox, a digital asset exchange developed and operated by Line, will run as a complete cryptocurrency exchange independent of the main messaging platform supporting 30 cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Ripple.\nThe Line team said in an official statement that initially, the exchange will not provide cryptocurrency-to-fiat trading support. If Line would have had established its trading platform in Japan, by obtaining a license from the Financial Services Agency (FSA), it could have been able to add fiat trading pairs.\nThe decision of the company to launch its exchange in Singapore complicated the process of integrating fiat currencies and acquiring support from local financial institutions. The team explained:\n“Cryptocurrency exchange BITBOX is launching as part of LINE’s financial services business, providing services globally except in Japan and the U.S. 30 or more cryptocurrencies can be exchanged in BITBOX, and it will support 15 languages excluding Japanese. BITBOX only allows the exchange of cryptocurrencies, and does not accept exchange between fiat money and cryptocurrencies.”\nLine emphasized that its trading platform will focus on improving security measures and internal management systems to prevent large-scale hacking attacks and security breaches as seen in the case of Coincheck’s $500 million hack in May. Line said that it has developed a secure system to handle demand for digital assets from its 200 million users,\nFollowing Dapp Initiative\nIn early May, Line secured a strategic partnership with ICON, a blockchain project based in South Korea valued at over $600 million, to facilitate the demand for blockchain-related products and decentralized applications from conglomerates and enterprises.\nThe ICON team stated that Line recognized the potential of the blockchain and the inevitable mainstream adoption of digital assets in the long-term. ICON said:\n“At current low adoption level, this access and impact would benefit ICON and the blockchain industry in a powerful way. We believe partnerships with players like LINE with such reach and scale are absolutely necessary for a wider and faster blockchain adoption. This is something we’ve all been waiting to see and we are glad to be the one make this happen.”\nAs of current, Line is focusing its resources on two main initiatives: its crypto exchange and decentralized application platform. In the long run, Line is planning to deploy decentralized applications that can be utilized by hundreds of millions of users on a day to day basis on public blockchain protocols like ICON and Ethereum, while seamlessly trading digital assets on a secure platform.\nThe commitment of a multi-billion dollar conglomerate to the cryptocurrency sector amidst the third worst correction in the history of the market can be considered as an optimistic indicator of mid to long-term recovery.\nThe post How Line, Japan’s Biggest Messaging App, is Going All Out on Crypto appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/30/how-line-japans-biggest-messaging-app-is-going-all-out-on-crypto/	2018-06-30 13:00:37+00	1

239	Blockchain CEO Sees Institutional Cryptocurrency Space as Immature	Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain, recently went on Bloomberg to give his opinion on the current state of institutional investment in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nWill Blockchain Principal Strategies Fill a Growing Need with Institutional Investors?\nAfter the recent launch of Blockchain Principal Strategies (BPS), Peter Smith, the CEO of Blockchain, went on Bloomberg to give additional insight into the BPS platform launch.\nFor those who are unaware, BPS is a platform aimed at enticing and facilitating institutional investment in the cryptocurrency industry. Blockchain plans on improving institutional access by providing over-the-counter (OTC) trading, offering the purchase and selling of a multitude of cryptocurrencies without affecting exchange order books.\nSmith went on to say that the current institutional investment environment around the cryptocurrency space is ‘immature,’ expecting that the BPS platform will fill a growing gap with institutional investors. This platform will be staffed by experienced money managers, well-versed in managing and trading assets in fast-paced environments.\nHe specifically stated:\n“There’s not a lot of really mature platforms out there that are staffed by the kind of people that institutions are used to dealing with. So really, institutions are looking to gain exposure in a safe way and increasingly they are motivated about getting the best execution. But today, the institutional market is fairly immature and fairly nascent.”\nWhen enquired about what makes BPS stand out from Coinbase‘s or Circle’s institutional investment services, the CEO noted that Blockchain intends to offer a variety of services, not just trading. Whether this is through research services, ‘deep-liquidity’ or custody services, Blockchain plans on offering a ‘much more comprehensive offering’ for institutional investors.\nPeter Smith Sees Institutional Investment Slowing\nSmith noted that institutions are currently only setting up for eventual investment, rather than putting money into the market in its current state. He elaborated, saying:\n“I think there are two separate things (for institutional investors). One is institutions wanting to set up, so they can trade and then there is the institutions wanting to trade. Right now you are seeing a lot more of the former, then the latter. I think you will have to see the market reverse before you see more of the latter.”\nContrary to popular belief, the Blockchain CEO mentioned that institutional investment in Asia isn’t as present as people put it out to be. In fact, a majority of the inbound investment is arriving from London and New York, where large financial institutions are often situated.\nDespite the variety of financial institutions, Smith noted that a majority of institutions investing in the market are large family offices or hedge funds, who are most likely looking for longer-term returns.\nSmith sees the London and New York markets as ‘limited,’ in terms of capital flow from traditional firms, acknowledging that the cryptocurrency market is still mostly retail driven. This statement should come as a surprise to some, as it was expected that institutional investors would empty their pockets for the industry en-masse.\nBut as stated by Smith before, the cryptocurrency market could take years to come to full fruition, when cryptocurrency and blockchain-related technologies begin to take over traditional systems. He wrote:\n“Investors should only invest if they believe in the long-term vision of creating a global, stateless, opt-in financial system. They should also be prepared to hold their position for a very long time. I know I am.”\nHopefully, a service like BPS can help to draw in institutional investment and involvement, which will undoubtedly become a vital aspect of the cryptocurrency market in the years to come.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Blockchain CEO Sees Institutional Cryptocurrency Space as Immature appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/29/blockchain-ceo-sees-institutional-cryptocurrency-space-as-immature/	2018-06-29 22:00:36+00	0

245	“Litecoin Isn’t Decoupling From BTC As it Edges Towards $50”: Litecoin (LTC) Technical Analysis	While fundamentals are supportive of Litecoin, the mere fact that Bitcoin is on a slide, adding on to their losses means there is more room for LTC downsides. The effect is can’t be clearer, so far it’s down six percent in the last 24 hours and likely to break below $70, our first bear target. For buyers to take charge, then we need to see bulls pushing prices above $110.\nFrom the News\nLine, a messaging platform and WhatsApp competitor is now setting its eyes on cryptocurrency. It’s not a surprise per say first because most of their clientele across Japan, Thailand and Taiwan are mostly millennials. The secondly, the cryptocurrency craze in South East Asia is irresistible necessitating them to set up an exchange, BitBox. Their initial coin list will be limited with ETH, BTC, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin available. However, they plan to add 30 more coins for their global clients exclusive of those from the US and Japan.\n\nLINE's virtual currency exchange, BITBOX, to launch July 2018. Bookmark official site for the launch! https://t.co/4UquVRnPdF #LINECONFERENCE pic.twitter.com/kUKXbVDEsX\n— BITBOX (@bitbox_official) June 28, 2018\n\nCoins available for trading have undergone “thorough screening” and are certified reliable and safe for trading. Line, who shall be launching their platform in Singapore by July, is taking a cautious approach considering the after math of Coincheck, CoinRail and lately BitHumb. These events did trigger regulatory involvement in South Korea and Japan. It’s mostly because of these stringent measures that the Japan and US regulatory bodies have in place that made them bar their citizens from trading at BitBox. Otherwise, other global customers can freely set up accounts and trade for free in the first month. Thereafter, a 0.1 percent commission will apply.\nWhile Line is diversifying, traders can now sign up with Belfrics, one of India’s fastest crypto exchanges and trade among others Litecoin. Belfrics are back in business after closing shop early this year after banks refused to offer services. In their bucket list is a grand plan of adding 20 more cryptocurrency now that they have a “dedicated app for live-order book trading of altcoins” and a secure mobile web wallet. Combined, both of these developments are good for crypto market and Litecoin in particular.\nLitecoin (LTC) Technical Analysis\nWeekly Chart\nLitecoin Weekly Chart by Trading View\nIn our analysis, the $110 support and sell trigger mark anchors our analysis. Before that, if prices had found support at that level and  inched higher, then we would have had a nice triple bottoms. Contrary to this trade plan, prices did slide following week ending June 10 and shows no signs of slowing down as the month comes to an end. In my view-and while aligning this trade plan to the general trend, selling on pull backs in lower time frames is reasonable. Despite this, we expect to see a pullback in the beginning of July and in that case, we expect the region between $90 and $110 to cap Litecoin’s buy pressure.\nDaily Chart\nLitecoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nEven though we were a little bit optimistic after June 27 bullish candlestick, the fact that LTC sellers swamped back reversing those gains on June 28 and 29 effectively cancels that buy trade plan. As such, my suggestion is to sell at current prices with stops at $90 and targets at $50.That in effect means trading with the general sell trend. Any breach above $90 and on the upper limit $110 cancels our bear stand.\nDisclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the author and aren’t investment advice.

247	April Saw Coinbase Customers Taking Out 37% More Money Than They Put In	During market lows, cryptocurrency enthusiasts have long urged each other to ‘hodl,’ which as many of us know is a word that came from typo for ‘hold,’ or ‘hold on for dear life.’ According to new data relating to Coinbase, faith in that principle may be waning.\nTo Hodl, or Not to Hodl\nWhen the price of Bitcoin rallied more than 30% in April, some cryptocurrency investors decided it was time to get out, rather than ‘hodl’ for a market surge. Looking back, it’s been more than six months since Bitcoin reached all-time highs at roughly $20,000 in December. Since then, the subsequent 70% crash and sustained bear market in the cryptosphere has tested the patience of investors, especially those who bought in amid the frenzy towards the end of 2017.\nAccording to new reports from Chime, a San Francisco-based bank startup that offers free credit and debit accounts, customers at the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., Coinbase, withdrew more from the company than they deposited in April.\nSince December, withdrawals from Coinbase have been increasing relative to deposits. However, April was the first and only month in which the money flowing out of Coinbase actually exceeded the money flowing in, Chime’s data shows. \nDuring that month, investors took 37% more money out of Coinbase than they put in, withdrawing $1.37 for every dollar deposited. In relation, deposits to Coinbase outweighed redemptions in May, but it was only by a 10% margin, or $1.10 for every dollar withdrawn.\nWorth pointing out is that Chime’s analysis is based on the behavior of roughly 500,000 active customers, most of whom are between ages 25 and 35.\nThe numbers, therefore, likely don’t fully reflect the activity of Coinbase’s more than 20 million users. The issue is that Coinbase also caters to institutional investors, a demographic that is likely not represented among Chime customers. Coinbase declined to comment with Fortune, who outlined the findings. \nDespite this potential misrepresentation, the findings do show that there is some sort of trend. Some would say the data highlights a negative sentiment among this subset of investors. \nWhat’s particularly strange is that in April cryptocurrency prices were actually rising, so it was not related to panic selling that can occur during a market plunge. This could be a sign that investors have turned pessimistic in their outlook for Bitcoin and their lack of confidence in the coin’s recovery. \nThe pattern also reflects a recent class of ‘rookie’ cryptocurrency investors who are out for quick profits, and who are not used to the volatility of cryptocurrencies. \n\n“You have a kind of washing out of momentum investors…investors who were not really taking a longterm point of view,” said Chad Cascarilla, cofounder and CEO of Paxos, an institutional trading firm that also operates Bitcoin exchange itBit.\n\nCEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, seemed to acknowledge this pattern in a tweet last week. He said that the prolonged downturn had made some investors give up on cryptocurrencies, but added that that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, saying that the shift served to get  ‘rid of the people who are in it for the wrong reasons.’\nChime’s CEO, Chris Britt, also spoke on the findings. He noted that this money flow patterns simply illustrates that investors’ market timing is poor:\n\n“Unfortunately, it’s human nature that investors often buy at the highest prices and sell at lower prices,” Britt said. “While we can’t predict the future value of Bitcoin, I suspect we may look back at the current prices a few years from now and see that these lower prices were a great time to buy.”\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post April Saw Coinbase Customers Taking Out 37% More Money Than They Put In appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/30/april-saw-coinbase-customers-taking-out-37-more-money-than-they-put-in/	2018-06-30 00:30:41+00	0

318	Korean Messaging App Kakao to Raise Funds for Crypto Move	The company behind Kakao, the most popular messaging app in South Korea, has suggested it will do a private placement next month to raise money for a crypto platform. The platform will be separate from the messaging app due to concerns over the lack of ICO regulations, Bloomberg reported on June 28.\nGround X to Seek Business Alliances\nA subsidiary of Kakao, Ground X Corp is a blockchain initiative based in Tokyo aimed at helping the company to succeed outside of South Korea. CEO Jason Han said, in an interview, that the company is looking at making capital and business alliances with consumer-service companies. They will aim for companies that have internet or mobile services that could be integrated with blockchain technology.\nGround X was set up in March 2018 following the boom in crypto prices and at the start of the recent bear market. They aim to have a test version by September 2018 and launch the product by the end of the year. Han said he wants to roll out a product that will be more practical as existing products and decentralized applications (dApps) are not very user-friendly. Han said:\n“The biggest problem with blockchain right now is that there isn’t a single service that an average person would use. Our services are going to be more practical. We’re going to create a service that people can use without having to learn the language of crypto.”\nThe product will provide services similar to Steemit which is a popular blockchain-based blog site. Users up-vote posts which get paid out to the content providers in STEEM. Han said that services that reward users for good content works well with blockchain technology.\nKakao to Expand Beyond Korea\nKakao is a $7.6 billion company with 50 million monthly users that are mostly based in South Korea. They have recently managed to expand to Japan with manga-app Piccoma. According to Bloomberg, other offerings failed in trying to crack other markets and Ground X was set up to help achieve this goal.\nGround X is also based in Japan due to uncertainty over crypto regulations. Even though South Korea’s citizens are strong advocates of blockchain technology, it still has a ban on ICOs. Considering the amount of money raised in ICOs so far this year, it’s easy to see why this is a priority for a new project, especially against so much competition.\n“We aren’t late here. We know we’re not frontrunners of blockchain technology. But the industry is still developing,” Han said.\nFor the blogging market, Ground X will have pre-existing competition in terms of Steemit which is already widely used. If they go down the messaging route, they are up against Telegram who cancelled their ICO after raising nearly $2 billion in private fundraising. In development is also Kin, operated by messaging app KIK which had 300 million users by 2016.\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Korean Messaging App Kakao to Raise Funds for Crypto Move appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/02/korean-messaging-app-kakao-to-raise-funds-for-crypto-move/	2018-07-02 02:30:37+00	1
319	Crypto Crying out for Regulation as Thailand Leads the Way	Industry professionals and CEOs of blockchain companies are clamouring for regulators to clarify the legal status of cryptocurrencies to open up innovation and help ‘smart money’ to move into the space. Thailand has shown how it can be done even if their policies are not crypto-friendly enough.\nRegulation Will Encourage Growth\nRegulation is often given a bad press but in light of the six-month bear market defining 2018, it appears that innovation is waiting on regulatory clarity. During London Tech Week, the common theme was that the industry wants clear regulation.\nSpeaking at the ‘Zeroing In On Europe’ conference on June 16, former Blackrock investor, Adam Grimsley, co-founder of Prime Factor Capital, said: \n“Concerns around volatility, lack of liquidity, and regulatory uncertainty were more than enough to prevent the so-called traditional smart money from entering the arena.”\nCoinbase UK CEO made a speech at the Blockchain Summit on June 13 in which he said that the industry needs to work with current financial institutions and educate them before we can achieve a crypto ‘utopia.’ Zeeshan Feroz, UK CEO of Coinbase, told NewsBTC:\n“From a government point of view, we should be engaging with the space and looking at how we facilitate it. The biggest step at this stage is regulation, give businesses some certainty and give them a framework to operate within that will help grow it.”\nA lot of ICOs have banned U.S. citizens from participating due to a lack of clarity over whether or not they classify as securities. Monaco VISA told U.S., India, Hong Kong and Singapore citizens that they are excluded due to ‘excessive regulatory risk.’ Rather than risk engaging with these markets, ICOs are just enforcing blanket bans to protect themselves, missing out on further funding and more development of the industry.\nSpeaking at BitcoinCRE on June 14, the founder of CPROP, Sandy Selman said: “We decided to use a tradeable entity. If it became a security it would kill our business. We decided not to take any U.S. money to not deal with the problem.”\nGovernments Can Regulate Crypto\nThailand has shown that governments can provide clear regulation on cryptocurrencies. In May, it enacted a regulatory framework for ‘digital assets and digital tokens.’ The bill sets out requirements for ICOs to register with the Thailand SEC to make sure that they comply with current laws. Although the taxes are currently quite high, it proves that governments can successfully regulate the industry.\n\nIn order to achieve the same clarity, the U.S. needs to decide which bodies are regulating cryptocurrencies. Recently, the SEC cleared up a few questions and confirmed that Ethereum is not a security but the IRS has deemed it property, and taxable. In response to the confusion, the state of Florida has created the position of a ‘crypto czar’ to help make state-specific regulations.\nAcross the globe, other countries need to speed up their decision-making processes. In Europe, the UK established a task force back in March and the European Commission launched the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum in February. However, no regulation has yet been made apart from an anti-money laundering agreement by the EU.\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Crypto Crying out for Regulation as Thailand Leads the Way appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/02/crypto-crying-out-for-regulation-as-thailand-leads-the-way/	2018-07-02 03:45:40+00	0
252	Founder of Infamous Silk Road To Stay in Prison	The US Supreme Court has conclusively ruled that Ross Ulbricht, the founder and mastermind behind the infamous dark web marketplace ‘Silk Road’, will stay behind bars for the rest of his days. Mr. Ulbricht, who is accused of distribution of drugs, hacking, money laundering, fraud and other charges, has been convicted to a life sentence in 2015.\nUlbricht, who was better known as ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’ in dark web, claimed that federal agents unlawfully tracked his internet activity, which led to his arrest and conviction. He also stated that life imprisonment with no possibility of parole was disproportionate punishment for the crimes he committed.\nUlbricht’s last chance was certiorari – an order by which a higher court reviews a case already tried in a lower court. However, the Supreme Court included the case of Ulbrich vs. United States in the list of 19 denied certiorari, seemingly bringing the case of one of the most prominent cyber criminals to a close, much to the dismay of his supporters, calling the court decision “crushingly disappointing”.\n\nSCOTUS denied #RossUlbricht cert petition this morning after holding it pending Carpenter. This is a NO on internet privacy and Ross's case. Devastating. #freeross https://t.co/u9Zwh2fqGj\n— Free_Ross (@Free_Ross) June 28, 2018\n\nTwenty organizations from opposite sides of the political spectrum expressed support for Ulbricht’s petition. These include Gun Owners of America, the Reason Foundation and the National Lawyers Guild.\nIn October of 2017, the US Department of Justice auctioned the 144,336 BTC seized in the closure of Silk Road for around $48 million.\nIt is estimated that around $183 million worth of drugs were sold on Silk Road and, according to the prosecution, at least six overdose deaths have been linked to the drugs bought on the dark web marketplace. Allegedly, Ulbricht also tried to hire hitmen for five murders in order to protect Silk Road’s anonymity, although there is no evidence any of them actually occurred.\nUlbricht charged a transaction fee in BTC for every trade in the platform and his net worth was estimated to be in the millions. Keep in mind that he was arrested in 2013, when BTC cost a mere $200. However, as the Silk Road grew, so did the FBI interest in it and the man behind its operations, which led to the inevitable conclusion of Ulbricht getting caught.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Founder of Infamous Silk Road To Stay in Prison appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/founder-of-infamous-silk-road-to-stay-in-prison/	2018-06-30 02:58:32+00	0

254	A Big Bounce as $20 Billion Pours Back into Crypto Markets	FOMO Moments\nThe big pump has happened, altcoins with double digit gains include Bitcoin Cash, Neo, Ethereum Classic, and Ontology\nThe bounce was expected however the magnitude of it is a very positive sign. Markets have been plummeting for weeks, and are still very low, however the rebound was far bigger than the previous one indicating that this could be the reversal everybody has been waiting for.\nBitcoin pumped $500 in about three hours which gives it a 9% gain on the day. Trading just below $5,900 this time yesterday it has now jumped back to the previous resistance level of just over $6,400. The rest of the altcoins naturally followed their master back up, with Ethereum jumping 7% to $450. Levels are still very low and may resume bearish momentum but the big pump is welcome news this Saturday morning.\n\nThe biggest movements at the moment can be seen in Bitcoin Cash rocketing 14% from $650 this time yesterday to $755 at the time of writing. Litecoin has bounced 10% back over $80 again, and Stellar has also seen a 10% gain to a touch under $0.20. Cardano, which has taken a bigger beating lately, is up 12.7% on the day to trade at $0.133.\nAlso getting abused lately has been Neo but it too has made a small recovery by 11.6% to just over $31 at the moment. Ethereum Classic is enjoying a 12.5% climb this morning to $16.30 and Ontology has risen over 14% to $5.44. Most of the other altcoins are up between 8-10% as they follow Bitcoin’s lead. In the top 30 0x is showing the biggest gains at the current time pumping 22.5% to trade at $0.73. In the total top 100 payments provider TenX has the largest gain on the day with a whopping 67% surge to $0.88.\nIt may be too early to get excited about this, which may turn out to be just another small correction before further losses. Total crypto market capitalization has jumped back over $250 billion with an 8% climb on the day. This equates to just over $19 billion going back into crypto markets in the past 6 hours to put them at the $255 billion level.

256	BitMEX CEO: Bitcoin Will Move to $50,000 by the End of 2018	Bitcoin has recently hit weekly highs after a quick bounce off a $5,800 low, BitMEX’s CEO calls for further moves upwards. \nBitcoin See Volume Pump, Moving $600 Upwards Within 5 Hours.\nOn Friday night, Bitcoin saw an unexpected surge in exchange volume, quickly bouncing from the $5,800 price level. \nBitcoin fell under $5,800 on Thursday, with many expecting further declines. Ran Neu Ner, host of CNBC Africa’s ‘Crypto Trader’ show called for $5350 within the upcoming weeks. However, the recent surge has brought Bitcoin up to $6400, finding stability in the vicinity of that level.\nChart Courtesy of TradingView\nDespite being a welcome piece of price action, users were quick to question why this happened. Taking a look at news sources, there does not seem to be a single catalyst for this price jump. \nSome chalked it up to the futures contract that expired today or the culmination of this week’s bullish news. Although the market would say otherwise, the past week has had a sizable level of positive news. Positive institutional investment news from Circle, Blockchain or Andreessen Horowitz are just one of the many examples of positive news. But sometimes the market moves irrationally, taking turns where there shouldn’t be any. \nMany in the cryptocurrency community are still uncertain about the future for Bitcoin. Leading some to ask, where could Bitcoin’s price be headed next?\nCEO Of BitMEX: Up! Up! Up!\nArthur Hayes, CEO of BitMEX, popular leveraged trading exchange, still has his eyes set on the $50,000 EOY price prediction that he made earlier this year. Hayes, a former traditional assets trader and a graduate of Wharton, has made a name for himself in the cryptocurrency industry after a tenure on the Asian ‘Wall Street’. \nHe has recently made an appearance on CNBC ‘Fast Money,’ which has become pronounced for near-daily appearances of cryptocurrency personalities and analysts. \nWhile on-air, Hayes noted that it was still reasonable for Bitcoin to reach new all-time highs, despite the recent downtrend. The CEO stated:\n\n“Well, I think that something that goes up to $20,000 in one year can have a correction down to around $6,000.”\nLater adding that the cryptocurrency market is perhaps “one positive regulatory decision away, maybe an ETF approved by the SEC, to climbing through $20,000 or even $50,000 by the end of the year.”\nHowever, when put up against the predictions of other cryptocurrency industry leaders, Hayes’ prediction stands above all the rest. Tom Lee, co-founder of FundStrat, has continually called for a $25,000 Bitcoin by the end of the year, just half of the BitMEX CEO’s prediction. \nMaybe he is overexuberant, some have thought, but others think this call is rational. Hayes went on to say that he believes the timespan for large price movements will shorten.\nHe attributed the shrinking time horizons for price action to the increase of participants in this rapidly growing market, elaborating:\n“In 2013 to 2015, we went for $1,200 to $200. In 2015 to 2017, (we went from) $200 To $20,000. So, we’ve done these sort of moves before. I think the time span is going to shorten because you have many more people involved in the market, who have invested capital and resources to trade this asset class.”\nThe increased liquidity and the large spike in interest were other factors leading Hayes to believe that “the time between an aggressive bear market and an aggressive bull market” will shorten.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nThe post BitMEX CEO: Bitcoin Will Move to $50,000 by the End of 2018 appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/30/bitmex-ceo-bitcoin-will-move-to-50000-by-the-end-of-2018/	2018-06-30 07:48:38+00	1

259	Chairman of Major Japanese Bank Says Ripple Can be the Global Standard of Money	At the Japan Blockchain Conference held on June 27, the biggest cryptocurrency and blockchain conference in Japan, Yoshitaka Kitao, the chairman of SBI Holdings and CEO of SBI Group, expressed his optimism towards the long-term growth of the Ripple blockchain network.\nXRP as Global Standard Currency\nAccording to a local cryptocurrency analyst CryptoEri, Kitao stated that XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple blockchain network, significantly optimizes the global financial system and has the potential to evolve into the global standard of cryptocurrency and money.\n“Mr Kitao, CEO of SBI Holdings, just a few minutes ago, spoke at Keynote in Tokyo Blockchain. He believes XRP will be the global standard. Mr Kitao added, ‘using XRP can create a more efficient world,’” CryptoEri reported.\nThe Japan Blockchain Conference is the largest conference in Japan that focuses on the discussion of the cryptocurrency market, including projects, emerging solutions, regulation, growth, and investment. The conference, which was attended by more than 10,000 individuals, partnered with some of the most influential financial conglomerates such as SBI Group and Nasdaq, featuring Ethereum and Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson and Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver as two of many other high profile entrepreneurs in the blockchain sector.\nAt the conference, Yoshitaka Kitao, who has overseen the second biggest bank in Japan since 2014, said that XRP has already created a more efficient ecosystem and platform for banks to use in settling cross-border payments with lower fees and shorter processing periods.\nReason Behind Optimism Towards Ripple\nIn January 2016, prior to the massive rally of XRP that led its market valuation to surpass $50 billion and the formation of an active community, SBI Holdings demonstrated its confidence in the potential of Ripple to target the traditional finance industry with blockchain-related products by initiating in a multinational deal, ahead of any other bank in Asia and the US.\nAt the time, Kitao, the chairman and CEO of SBI Holdings, said that XRP is the only company with “battle-tested” solutions that can optimize bank transactions and operations.\n“Surveying the market, Ripple was the only company that has delivered battle-tested enterprise solutions and global bank customer traction, including commercial deals with top banks already signed in Asia Pacific. Distributed financial technology is undoubtedly transforming financial infrastructure and we’re excited to drive its adoption throughout Asia,” Kitao said more than two years ago.\nSince then, SBI Holdings has led local banks and financial institutions in South Korea including Kookmin and Shinhan, the country’s two largest commercial banks, to deploy Ripple and to utilize the Ripple blockchain network to conduct cross-border transactions.\nIn March, NewsBTC previously reported that Woori, the third largest bank in South Korea, hinted full integration of XRP after testing Ripple’s blockchain-related solutions throughout late 2017 and early 2018.\n“The South Korean bank already completed phase two of its Ripple trials, having completed phase one of Ripple payment settlement in January. Woori spokesperson told Chosun that the bank remains highly optimistic in using the Ripple network to process remittance in the long-term,” NewsBTC reported.\nThe optimism towards the Ripple blockchain protocol and its native token XRP from Kitao originate from the enthusiastic approach of both Japanese and South Korean banks in integrating various Ripple solutions like xRapid and xCurrent that are capable of improving the liquidity of banking systems.\nThe post Chairman of Major Japanese Bank Says Ripple Can be the Global Standard of Money appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/30/chairman-of-major-japanese-bank-says-ripple-can-be-the-global-standard-of-money/	2018-06-30 10:47:46+00	0

261	One of the Biggest VC Firms Says Cryptocurrency Can be Worth Trillions of Dollars	Union Square Ventures, a New York-based venture capital firm that oversees a billion dollars in capital, has revealed that it is investing in cryptocurrency and major digital assets like bitcoin as long-term investments.\nWinning Blockchain Will be Worth Many Trillions\nFounded and operated by Fred Wilson, a prominent venture capital investor known for his early investments in multi-billion dollar companies Twitter, Tumblr, Zynga, Etsy, and Coinbase, Union Square Ventures has quickly become a leading investment firm within the blockchain sector and technology industry within the past decade.\nWithin a decade, the company has built a valuable portfolio of startups valued at several billion dollars such as world’s largest online developer community Stackoverflow, Foursquare, audio sharing platform Soundcloud, the world’s biggest crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, and the global cryptocurrency market’s largest exchange and brokerage Coinbase.\nThis week, in an interview with CNBC, Albert Wegner, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, said that USV has allocated a significant portion of its capital into the cryptocurrency market as a long-term investment and it intends to continue investing in both emerging cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups.\nBut, Wenger said that the venture capital firm is not ready to create a major fund dedicated to the cryptocurrency market unlike Andreessen Horowitz, another leading VC firm that created a $300 million fund committed to the cryptocurrency sector.\n“We’re not planning to do it,” said Wenger, referring to the creation of a separate and independent fund for the cryptocurrency sector. “We see a lot of upside to keeping it under the same roof.”\nWenger added that whichever cryptocurrency that survives and weathers large bubbles that will emerge in the future will be worth several trillions of dollars.\n“Investors are rationally pouring a lot of money into this sector, because I think people are seeing the winning blockchain here might be worth a trillion, or a couple of trillion dollars. It’s not at all crazy to think that. Certainly, for any one particular project there’s an extremely high chance it won’t work. As a result, if it works, the rewards will be very high.”\nWenger is a Bitcoin Holder But Says Holding Only Bitcoin Isn’t Recommended\nWenger has been an early investor in bitcoin for several years and has extensively observed the cryptocurrency market over the past few years. He emphasized that investors should not only hold bitcoin and hope it to remain dominant, especially of investors have a significant share of their life savings in bitcoin.\n“I don’t think you should be in the space and say ‘I’m going to only hold bitcoin. At the moment, this whole space is a high risk space and I don’t think anybody should be investing all of their life savings.”\nThe best investment strategy to utilize in a high volatile market that is still at its infancy is to diversify investments in various cryptocurrencies that have active developer communities and user activity, rather than allocating all of the life savings into a single digital asset.\nThe post One of the Biggest VC Firms Says Cryptocurrency Can be Worth Trillions of Dollars appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/30/one-of-the-biggest-vc-firms-says-cryptocurrency-can-be-worth-trillions-of-dollars/	2018-06-30 12:00:03+00	0

275	Polish Bitcoin Association Challenges Banks	The Polish Bitcoin Association (PBS) is launching a challenge to banks over alleged refusals to provide their services to firms in the business of cryptocurrencies.\nPoland has not had the best history with cryptocurrencies. Back in March Toshi Times asked whether the European nation was becoming a crypto-authoritarian state after it was argued that under new taxation arrangements for cryptocurrency, investors might end up paying more than 100% of their earnings in tax. Further back than that, it emerged that the Polish Central Bank was slipping anti-crypto ads into YouTube videos in an attempt to dissuade would-be investors from taking on the risk.\nNow it seems the approach is getting more blunt; a number of crypto-related businesses in the country allege that they have been refused service by banks because of their links with cryptocurrency. In response to this, the Polish Bitcoin Association (PBS) has sent an appeal to the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (OCCP) to intervene under breach of competition rules. The letter was filed on the 26th of June.\nInside it, the PBS is said to have named 15 institutions which are said to have denied services to 52 entities, as well as closing the accounts of 25 entities. The PBS goes on to allege that a full list of these refusals is held by MBank, one of the nations largest financial institutions, which itself apparently made 9 refusals and closed 3 accounts associated with crypto.\nIt remains however unclear whether the OCCP will pursue the case.\nPoland’s seemingly conservative attitude toward cryptocurrency in the past has aroused fears of where the country will head regarding the new asset class. Some have aired fears that it may take a lead from more hard-line examples like China in its conservatism. However, despite the government’s apparently negative stance, it remains true that there have been no actual laws passed targeting cryptocurrency directly; a draft bill to combat money laundering remains the most significant piece of legal coding. Aleksandra Wiktorow, the Polish Financial Ombudsman has also called on regulation to not be “excessive”; what shape Polish regulation may eventually take is nevertheless still not decided, and may surprise us yet.\nImage Source: “Flickr”\nThe post Polish Bitcoin Association Challenges Banks appeared first on Toshi Times.	5	https://toshitimes.com/polish-bitcoin-association-challenges-banks/	2018-06-30 16:06:21+00	0

284	Is Bitcoin Feasible as an Institutional Investment?	Cryptocurrency analysts, community members, and personalities all portray institutional investment as the ‘holy grail’ of the industry, but is it really feasible? \nSlow Institutional Adoption\nThe release of the Bitcoin codebase and whitepaper were far from publicized. Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin block in 2009, under the watchful eyes of nearly no one. At the time, only a handful of individuals held an interest in this project, with others calling it “a failure” or “useless.”\nBut since the 2016-2017 bull run, sentiment has changed, bringing cryptocurrencies out from under the shadows and into the limelight. Now not a niche asset, meant only for internet ‘geeks,’ Bitcoin’s price has erupted, inspiring the creation of hundreds of other cryptocurrency projects.\nHowever, Bitcoin’s price movement from $1,000 to $6,000 in 18 months, has been largely attributed to retail investors making speculative investments. Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain, stated that a large majority of the cryptocurrency market is still driven by retail investors, investors like you or me.\nAlthough there is nothing wrong with retail interest, the institutions hold all or at least a majority of the cards. Whether it be through the immense capital they utilize or the array of connections they hold, institutional investors are a force to be reckoned with.  As the New York Times puts it, “(it’s) basic math.”\nWhen put on the scale of the global economy, the cryptocurrency market is nothing but a tiny blip, a grain of sand in a towering pile of rocks. Although the cryptocurrency industry has a collective market capitalization of $250 billion, the cryptocurrency market’s growth only required the investment of a fraction of that figure.\nBut institutions, like hedge funds, banks or retirement trusts, hold the keys to trillions of dollars of assets, becoming a great target for the cryptocurrency industry.\nDue to the aforementioned reasons, institutional investment has become a key topic of discussion for members of the cryptocurrency community. Many analysts see it as the next step in becoming a truly global, and influential asset class. \nHowever, the widespread and dominating presence of retail investors has mostly blocked out institutional investors. With only a few firms getting their hands dirty — putting time, interest, and capital into the cryptocurrency industry.  \nBarriers to Entry for Institutions\nIn its current state, the market is highly speculative, with a majority of investors looking to make a quick buck. Institutional investors have seen that, and have mostly shied away from opening their wallets for the industry. These investors are looking for long-term returns, securing the trust of consumers over time rather than making a quick buck.\nInstitutional investors cringe when they apply traditional economic sense to the cryptocurrency industry, due to the variance and unpredictability that has become cryptocurrency’s common nature.\nAdditionally, even if institutions want to trade or invest in the industry, they are often stopped by the lack of infrastructure supporting investors who hold zero crypto knowledge.\nPeter Smith, the aforementioned CEO of Blockchain, has recently said that the institutional investment space around cryptocurrencies is “immature.”\nFurther noting that the institutional services currently offered are far from sufficient, usually only offering high-liquidity over-the-counter (OTC) trading options. Although OTC trading is welcome, many services like Circle Trade, lack research tools or expert analysis which institutions need. Blockchain, a popular crypto-infrastructure company, has just announced Blockchain Principal Strategies, aimed at hedge funds, high-net-worth individuals, and other institutions.\nBPS offers what the others do not. Some speculate that it could become a large catalyst for institutional investment, drawing in more firms than ever before.\nEven if BPS doesn’t succeed, cryptocurrency firms will try their hands, again and again, attempting to draw the eyes of institutional investors.\nAnalysts continually call 2018 the “year of institutional investment,” with many echoing that sentiment. But time will only tell if 2018 will shape up to what analysts expect.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Is Bitcoin Feasible as an Institutional Investment? appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/30/is-bitcoin-feasible-as-an-institutional-investment/	2018-06-30 19:45:20+00	0

287	DeadCoins Brings Attention to 800 Lifeless Cryptos	Initial coin offerings (ICOs) were the talk of the town last year, drawing the eyes and ears of worldwide investors. However, DeadCoins has reported that over 800 cryptocurrencies now lay lifeless, with many of these projects enlisting business practices reminiscent of scams. \n‘DeadCoins’ Says Over 800 Cryptocurrencies Now Lay Lifeless\nDeadCoins, a collection of cryptocurrency ‘eulogies’, now has a list of over 800 cryptocurrencies that lack a promising outlook.\nAlthough this may be poking fun at these 800 projects, the issue still remains. That is, the growing issue with questionable projects attempting to draw the attention of unsuspecting investors. \nTake the example of World of Battles, an ICO project that shouldn’t ring any bells. Although a novel idea, World of Battles quickly fell under suspicion from seasoned cryptocurrency community members, who pointed out the malpractices which the project utilized. Most obviously, the blatant use of another project’s logo, modifying it in the slightest to trick the naive. \nThis project is one of the over 800 ‘dead coins’, falling into the category of ICO scams. Other reasons for ‘death’ range from abandoned projects to an SEC investigation, and everything in between. \nCryptoMeth and EzCoin, names of projects that should make any cautious investor cower, also met their demise. This left some to wonder, how these projects stayed afloat at all.  Some chalked it up to the gullibility of some investors, who were promised riches and investment success.  \nAlthough the aforementioned list already seems overwhelming, it is widely speculated that the DeadCoins list is far from complete. Some have even gone to say that even the 1,500 cryptocurrencies, mostly comprised of ICOs, on CoinMarketCap should not be free from suspicion.  \nMarket Analysis: 80% of ICOs Are Frauds\nAn author at Bloomberg, Aaron Brown, gave his analysis of the current state of ICOs, writing:\n“There has obviously been significant fraud and hype in the ICO market. I have seen 80 percent of ICOs were frauds, and 10 percent lacked substance and failed shortly after raising money. Most of the remaining 10 percent will probably fail as well.”\nIt is argued that 2017 and 2018 are the “years of the ICO,” as retail investors have continually emptied their pockets for the ‘hottest’ projects. Despite the presence of promising crypto projects, many ICOs have been exposed as fraudulent, promoting unrealistic goals and returns. \nAccording to data from Satis Group, an ICO advisory and analysis firm, over 80% of ICOs with a $50 million market cap and above are scams. The 80% figure lines up with what the Bloomberg analyst has seen as well, bringing even more credence to the extremely alarming statistic. \nAn additional 11% of projects have failed or gone silent, not the most promising statistic for the ICO market. \nThat’s the issue, the legitimate ICOs, ones who promote real-world use cases are overshadowed by the multitude of ICO cons that have no real product or use case.  \nICO scams are one of the main reasons why regulators want to regulate the industry, as fraudulent projects have drawn in millions, if not billions of dollars of investments. As the CEO of Blockchain said in an appearance on Bloomberg, regulators are mainly focused on consumer protection. \nThe ICO market is on thin ice, with the ICO scam ‘endemic’ edging out all but a few bona fide projects.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post DeadCoins Brings Attention to 800 Lifeless Cryptos appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/30/deadcoins-brings-attention-to-800-lifeless-cryptos/	2018-06-30 21:30:03+00	1

314	EOS Whales Cornering the RAM Market, Driving Prices Up: EOS, Litecoin, Stellar Lumens, Tron and IOTA Technical Analysis	It’s no secret that EOS is a promising project but it isn’t short of drama. After several voting issues, RAM speculation dominates headlines and prohibiting DApp implementation because RAM is expensive. As this happens, Litecoin and Stellar Lumens (LTC) are finding support. In my view, IOTA looks promising and as it prints a double bottom in the daily chart, odds are we might see gains in the coming days.\nLets’ have a look at these charts:\nEOS Technical Analysis\nEOS Daily Chart by Trading View\nThe odds are tipped negatively against users planning on using the EOSIO blockchain to run a DApp or execute a smart contract. It’s all about RAM, a network level resource that’s the center of speculation.  It’s emerging that Block Producers are collaborating to systematically hike the prices of RAM at the expense of genuine network users.\n\nThe prices of #EOS ram is now more than 1000x the server-ram-market-price*42. Utilization is negligible, people are playing Lambo games on it. Block Producers claim they need more data, before the add more (really?!?). Dapp devs are left on the cold. Let's fix this asap. pic.twitter.com/vP7Lqd5VoS\n— ZeroPass (@zeropassio) June 28, 2018\n\nFor a lack of better words, some redditors are calling this “insider trading”. It smells like one and why not? Super node centralization enables them to determine the amount of RAM in circulation and by extension price.\nAnd it doesn’t matter your argument. Common sense dictates that the amount of RAM in supply is irrelevant, BPs can quickly speculate on what the demand of RAM would be in the future and profit from that insider knowledge, at common user expense. As it stands, 0.11 EOS are needed to purchase 1kb of RAM.\nAs DApp get hurt because of RAM speculation and hoarding, EOS is relatively stable. It found support at $7 and might find its way up. The thing is: we still are bearish on EOS regardless of this “across the board recovery” until we see prices edge strongly above $9. That’s our immediate resistance line. After that, my suggestion would be to buy on dips as traders align themselves with a bull break out pattern.\nLitecoin (LTC) Technical Analysis\nLitecoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nThe Winklevoss Twins are important in the blockchain ecosystem and have been in this cycle for a while now. In their view, Bitcoin has the portability property that makes this “digital Gold better than gold”. Both share the fungibility and scarcity elements that make them so valuable. Unlike Bitcoin, they think Litecoin is but a test-net, a lab for Bitcoin and developers behind Litecoin didn’t risk anything big. That’s why it has a relatively low market cap.\n\nWinklevoss Twins#Bitcoin could can be the market capitalization similar to that of gold, which is currently valued at $7 trillion. Bitcoin, has a “potential appreciation of 30 to 40 times,” which would set the Bitcoin price above $320,000 market ap of at least $4 trillion $btc\n— Crypto Exeprt (@CryptoBest) June 30, 2018\n\nCoinBase daily chart shows that LTC did found support at around $70 with a nice confirmation of bullish pockets on June 29. It’s towing in perfectly with BTC prices. Overly, there is an optimism wave but I maintain that sellers are in charge. That’s until after we see buyers pushing prices above $90 or more safely above June 22 highs at $100 confirming that indeed there have been a shift of momentum and buyers are in charge.\nThat’s a reserved approach and it isn’t limiting for buyers keen of entering in earlier and risking less. In that case they should buy at current spot rates with stops at $70 and aim for $110 as their immediate buy targets. After all, June 29 volumes were high relative to the past 10 trading volumes.\nStellar Lumens (XLM) Technical Analysis\nStellar Lumens Daily Chart by Trading View\nOf all the coins, Stellar Lumens prices seem to be bottoming out. For example, in the last seven days, it’s up three percent as XLM buyers begin reversing May-June losses. In my view, we might end up seeing the completion of a W-formation and a double bottom if there are price appreciations above 25 cents. Once that happen, momentum would have switched and I suggest buying on retracements on lower time frames. Before them, let’s take a neutral approach and exit shorts.\nTron (TRX) Technical Analysis\nTron Daily Chart by Trading View\nThe Tron foundation and Justin Sun are doing everything they can to prop TRX prices. Since launch, 50 billion TRX coins have now been burnt. Encouragingly, we are yet to see network technical hitches and things like those leading to network halting. The only undoing is that most TRX coins are held by exchanges-especially Binance which is intentionally locking coins for security purposes. This is surely impeding Super Representatives election which is nevertheless progressing smoothly.\n\n49,490,749,752.120578 #TRX ERC20 token were burnt by #TRON Foundation. https://t.co/2iF859kHyP\n— Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) June 30, 2018\n\nOn the charts, TRX attempts to edge past 4 cents were futile and as such, we remain bearish until after that happens. Remember, that’s the only way buyers would announce themselves in an otherwise bearish market. Should prices slide below June 29 lows at around 3.3 cents, then sellers should search for pull backs in lower time frames and sell with a targets at 2.5 cents. Stops would be at 4 cents.\nIOTA (IOT) Technical Analysis\nIOTA Daily Chart by Trading View\nAfter yesterday’s price action and bounce of April lows, it looks like we now have a nice double bottom. Note that bulls are following though the last three days bullish candlestick with respectable trade volumes.\nIdeally, we would want to see a complete reversal of June 22 bearish engulfing pattern but then that means buyers must edge above $1.3 to validate that stand. That’s what I would suggest but odds are high that hawks might push prices there. Therefore, my trade plan is to buy at current prices with stops at 88 cents and targets at $2 or June highs.\nDisclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the author and aren’t investment advice.

293	Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis: BCH/USD Facing Tough Resistance	Key Points\n\nBitcoin cash price started a new upside wave from the $650 support area against the US Dollar.\nThere are two bearish trend lines formed with resistance at $770 and $810 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\nThe pair must break and settle above the $800 resistance zone to gain upside momentum.\n\nBitcoin cash price is slowly recovering above $700 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to move past the $800-810 barrier to remain in a bullish zone in the near term.\nBitcoin Cash Price Resistance\nThis past week, there were heavy losses in bitcoin cash price below the $1,000 level against the US Dollar. The BCH/USD pair declined and broke the $800 and $700 support levels. However, the $650 level acted as a decent support and prevented further declines. A low was formed at $651 and the price started an upward recovery. It gained pace and broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $931 high to $651 low.\nHowever, the price is facing a major hurdle around the $800 level. There are two bearish trend lines formed with resistance at $770 and $810 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair. The 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $931 high to $651 low is also positioned near $791. More importantly, the 100 simple moving average (4-hours) is also positioned near the $800 level to act as a major resistance.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price must break and settle above the $800 resistance zone to move further higher in the near term. The next resistance above $800-810 is around the $900 level. On the downside, supports are seen near the $720, $700 and $650 levels.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is back in the bullish zone with positive signs.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now well above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $700\nMajor Resistance Level – $810\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis: BCH/USD Facing Tough Resistance appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/01/bitcoin-cash-price-weekly-analysis-bch-usd-facing-tough-resistance/	2018-07-01 04:08:23+00	0
294	Ethereum Price Weekly Analysis: Can ETH/USD Break This?	Key Highlights\n\nETH price managed to recover higher after forming a low near the $404 level against the US Dollar.\nThere is a monster bearish trend line formed with resistance near $456 on the 4-hours chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\nThe pair has to move above the $456 and $480 resistance levels to gain upside momentum.\n\nEthereum price is facing a major resistance versus the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ETH/USD must clear the $456 hurdle to test the next hurdle at $480.\nEthereum Price Upside Hurdles\nThis past week, there was a nasty decline from well above $450 in ETH price against the US Dollar. The ETH/USD pair tumbled and traded towards the $400 handle. A low was formed at $404.46 before the price started an upside correction. It bounced back above $430 and cleared the 23.6% fib retracement level of the last drop from the $549 high to $404 low.\nHowever, the price faced a crucial resistance near the $456-460 zone. There is a monster bearish trend line formed with resistance near $456 on the 4-hours chart of ETH/USD. The same trend line is positioned near the previous support area at $460. Moreover, the 38.2% fib retracement level of the last drop from the $549 high to $404 low is also near $460. Therefore, a break above the trend line and $456 resistance is needed for more gains. Above this, the next hurdle is near the 100 simple moving average (4-hours) and $480. Above $480, the price will most likely clear the $500 resistance for more gains.\n\nThe above chart indicates that the price may find it very difficult to clear the $456-460 zone. If it fails to move higher, it could correct lower towards $440 and $430. Any further declines may perhaps put the price back in a bearish zone towards $410.\n4-hours MACD – The MACD is back in the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI – The RSI is currently well above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $430\nMajor Resistance Level – $456\nThe post Ethereum Price Weekly Analysis: Can ETH/USD Break This? appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/01/ethereum-price-weekly-analysis-can-eth-usd-break-this/	2018-07-01 05:18:54+00	0
295	Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis: BTC/USD Showing Recovery Signs	Key Points\n\nBitcoin price made a short-term low near $5,800 and bounced back against the US Dollar.\nThere was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $6,280 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\nThe pair is currently trading with a positive bias above the $6,000 support area.\n\nBitcoin price is showing positive signs against the US Dollar. BTC/USD may perhaps extend the current wave towards the $6,500 and $6,600 resistance levels.\nBitcoin Price Support\nThis past week, bitcoin price faced a lot of selling interest as it declined below the $6,000 level against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded below the $5,800 level and tested the $5,650 support. A low was formed at $5,654 and the price started an upward correction. It moved back above the $6,000 resistance and traded with a bullish bias.\nIt cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $6,832 high to $5,654 low. More importantly, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $6,280 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. At the moment, the price is consolidating gains near the $6,400 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). A break above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $6,832 high to $5,654 low is needed for buyers to gain traction. The next hurdles on the upside are at $6,500 and $6,600.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price is showing a few positive signs above the $6,000 level. However, it must break the $6,500 resistance and settle above the 100 SMA. If not, there is a chance of a bearish reaction back towards $6,000. Below this, the price will most likely retest the $5,800 support area.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is moving nicely in the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now well above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $6,000\nMajor Resistance Level – $6,500\nThe post Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis: BTC/USD Showing Recovery Signs appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/01/bitcoin-price-weekly-analysis-btc-usd-showing-recovery-signs/	2018-07-01 06:28:16+00	5

297	Crypto Week In Review: Institutional Investors are On-Boarding, Bithumb Recovers $16 Million	The week did not leave much to be desired for, with the market seeing a variety of positive institutional news amidst volatile price movements. \nInstitutional Investment Dominates The News Cycle\nThe presence of traditional institutions has been an important topic of discussion in the cryptocurrency community. Many analysts expect that widespread institutional investment will usher in a new level of cryptocurrency adoption and innovation, quickly reaching and surpassing all-time highs. \nAnnouncements made this week have shown the growth of the institutional environment around cryptocurrencies and related technologies.\nCircle Sees 30% Growth in Investment On OTC Trading Service\nDespite worrying prices, Circle has recently announced growth statistics for its OTC trading platform, meant for institutional investment.\nThe figures which Circle announced took many by surprise, with the Goldman-Sachs backed company seeing a 30% increase in institutional investors joining its platform in May alone. Due to this large influx of customers, Circle has been making moves to improve its service, offering support for high-frequency trades and larger orders.\nJeremy Allaire, The CEO of Circle, said:\n“A lot of folks on the institutional side are on-boarding, and getting their ducks in the row.”\nAdditionally, Circle has seen a 15 times increase in volume in comparison to one year ago, with the platform facilitating $2 billion worth of trades each and every month.\nBlockchain Launches Versatile Platform Aimed At Institutional Investors\nBlockchain, the popular cryptocurrency infrastructure provider, has just revealed the creation of Blockchain Principal Strategies (BPS). BPS, run by experienced analysts, managers, and traders from well-known financial establishments, is aimed at supporting firms joining the space. The platform is expected to offer research services, high-liquidity OTC trading, and early-access to ICOs.\nPeter Smith, CEO at Blockchain, hopes that this new product will help to fill a growing gap in this “immature” institutional investment environment.\nAnd many think it will, as BPS offers services that will become increasingly important as the market continues to expand, drawing the interest of Wall Street.\nAndreessen Horowitz Launches $300 Million Crypto Fund\nAndreessen Horowitz, a world-renowned venture capitalist firm, has just publicized that it has raised $300 million for investments in the cryptocurrency space.  The VC fund plans on investing in a variety of cryptocurrency projects, from large names like Ethereum to newer coins which have potential.\nCharles Dixon, a general partner at AH, expressed the firm’s hopes for the industry, stating:\n“We’ve experienced ups and downs in the cryptocurrency market, and expect there will be many more, There’s potential in the technology, and some of the downturns can be the best investments.”\nIt is widely expected that this fund will be the first of many, with many other venture capital firms expected to follow suit, issuing similar investment strategies.\nMarket Sees Tumultuous Week Of Gutwrenching Price Action\nLast week saw the $30 million hack of Bithumb, leading to a rapid move downwards, with Bitcoin quickly losing 3%. Although Bithumb recently announced the recovery of half of the lost funds, bearish sentiment has remained. \nBitcoin has hit $5800 multiple times throughout the week, finding some resistance on those levels. Ran Neu Ner, the founder of OnChain Capital, has called for a further short-term downtrend, seeing $5350 as the next level on the way down.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has recently bounced off the $5800 price level, seeing an unexpected $600 surge coupled with a bump in trading volume. At the time of writing, it is still unclear as to what caused such a price movement. Some think its the notorious ‘Bart Simpson’ pattern, where Bitcoin sees a quick move upwards, followed by a move down, ’emulating’ the hair of the popular T.V. character.\nHowever, others think that Bitcoin is beginning to break from bearish price movements, finding support at $5800 and bouncing off the lows.\nWhether it be a reverse in technicals or an increase in positive fundamental news, things may be beginning to look up for the industry, which has been continually beaten down for months.\n \nFeatured Image from\nThe post Crypto Week In Review: Institutional Investors are On-Boarding, Bithumb Recovers $16 Million appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/01/crypto-week-in-review-institutional-investors-are-on-boarding-bithumb-recovers-16-million/	2018-07-01 09:00:02+00	1

301	Security Firm Identifies Potential Tether (USDT) Double-Spend Bug	SlowMist, a Chinese cybersecurity firm, has recently pointed out a transaction that should have some worried, as the user managed to double the value of 694 USDT.\nSlowMist: User \nOn Thursday, a blockchain centric cybersecurity firm, issued a Tweet which drew attention to a questionable USDT transaction.\n\n交易所在进行USDT充值交易确认是否成功时存在逻辑缺陷，未校验区块链上交易详情中valid字段值是否为true，导致“假充值”，用户未损失任何USDT却成功向交易所充值了USDT，而且这些 USDT 可以正常进行交易。我们已经确认真实攻击发生！相关交易所应尽快暂停USDT充值功能，并自查代码是否存在该逻辑缺陷。 pic.twitter.com/EPzZIsZFzH\n— SlowMist (@SlowMist_Team) June 28, 2018\n\nAccording to the automated translation of the Tweet, originally given in Mandarin Chinese, the user was able to illegitimately add USDT value to the exchange’s server, giving a guise of added funds. \nThis vulnerability essentially allowed the user to be potentially credited for USDT that was not sent to the exchange.\nIt is unclear whether the exchange affected, which remained unnamed, has made any actions to amend the issue. \nAccording to the information of the transaction in question, the exchange accepted a transaction that had invalid information, with the exchange marking the 694 USDT “false” transaction as valid. \nWhen the Tweet was first released, it was unclear whether this problem was an unlucky edge-case or a problem that affected all of the 2.75 Billion Tether tokens in existence.\nBug Is Only Pertinent To Vulnerable Exchange\nSlowMist later clarified, in English this time, that the issue was not with Tether as a whole, but rather with the unnamed exchange.\nA Reddit user who goes by Dacoinminster gave his/her reasoning for the hack. To add to the legitimacy of the reasoning, the user claimed to be a founder of Omni, the protocol which Tether is built upon. \nFirstly, the Reddit user noted that Omni-based assets cannot be double-spent without Bitcoin having to be double-spent as well. This comment eased the double-spend worries, as a double-spend attack on Bitcoin is nearly impossible. \nThe Omni founder wrote:\nIf I’m translating this correctly, it appears that what happened here is that an exchange wasn’t checking the valid flag on transactions. They accepted a transaction with valid=false (which they should not have), and then the second “double spend” transaction had valid=true, which they also accepted.\nDacoinminster went on to say that the issue was the result of “poor exchange integration,” pointing an accusing finger at the affected exchange. \nOKEx, one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, quickly created a press release regarding the issue, adding to the legitimacy of the issue. OKEx wrote: \nWe are aware of the vulnerability with USDT deposit. And we confirm that OKEx is NOT exposed to the vulnerability. Please rest assured that your assets are safe and secure with us.\nFurther adding that OKEx enlisted the help of SlowMist to ensure that OKEx was not vulnerable to the “fake deposit” issue. \nBittrex also confirmed that it was not affected and the processing of all Omni-based assets, like Tether, did not experience any difficulties. The Tweet stated, “Bittrex properly handles the “valid” flag mentioned in the (Omni) integration guide.”\nIt has become clear that this issue is only pertinent to exchanges who failed to properly integrate Omni assets, most likely smaller exchanges with smaller technical teams. At the time of writing, the unnamed exchange was the only platform reported to be vulnerable to the bug. \nTether Remains The Topic Of Controversy\nDespite holding a vital role in the industry, serving as a way investors can find stability in the often volatile crypto market, Tether has had its fair share of problems.\nAs Tether’s market cap quickly rose over the billion dollar valuation, users began to question the legitimacy of the reserve funds backing the popular stablecoin. Speculation raged, as Tether unexpectedly dismissed an auditor for the “excruciatingly detailed procedures” the auditor firm was enlisting.\nMany thought that Tether did not hold the funds to back its growing supply of USDT. However, it was recently revealed that Tether does hold the U.S. dollars to back all USDT in existence.\nAlthough that issue was dismissed, research has pointed out that Tether may be responsible for the manipulation of many Bitcoin price movements. The report, originating from the University of Texas, states that the issuances of Tether may have caused up to 50% of all Bitcoin price increases.\nAlthough not directly addressed by the Tether organization, this report confirms much of the sentiment held by Tether critics.\nThe recent bug exposed by SlowMint has added to the Tether controversy, which has become increasingly diverse as Tether continues to grow at a rapid rate.\n \nFeatured Image from \nThe post Security Firm Identifies Potential Tether (USDT) Double-Spend Bug appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/01/security-firm-identifies-potential-tether-usdt-double-spend-bug/	2018-07-01 10:30:08+00	0
315	Bitcoin Futures Trading Volumes Are Too “Negligible” to Affect Bitcoin Prices: Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis	It’s the dawn of a new month and in what will likely be the beginning of Bitcoin reversing previous losses. For perspective, Bitcoin prices are up three percent in a week over week basis. Because of these developments, Bitcoin bulls can begin looking for triggers on dips to load up in lower time frames.\nFrom the News\nThe consensus method behind Bitcoin (BTC) is power intensive and not “Eco-friendly”. Besides, this method has evolved and expensive gadgets are required for “mining”. So, with news that heavy flooding in Chinese province of Sichuan causing “extensive” damage on mining gear as reported by Global Finance, many were worried that that the total hash rate of the network would take a hit.\n\nEric Meltzer, a partner at INBlockchain, the largest blockchain-focused fund in China, reported that rumors suggest a bitcoin mining facility in China was destroyed by a massive flood that affected the entire province of Sichuan, China. pic.twitter.com/6oViROPVUo\n— ok (@dlrufkgk) July 1, 2018\n\nBut luckily, according to data from Blockchain.com, the Bitcoin network hash rate actually rose during those two days. This might be all thanks to the design of the Bitcoin and underlying blockchain technology. The decentralization and distribution design did bring in stability regardless of the fact that close to 70 percent of the world’s Bitcoin mining happen in China. Most of this takes place in the provinces of Sichuan where it’s relatively cold and the cost of electricity is comparatively low.\nIn other news, do you think the introduction of Bitcoin Futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is the force behind this year’s BTC declines? There are solid reasons to believe because according to a research paper published at the Federal Reserve of San Francisco site, the peaking of BTC prices did coincide with the CME’s listing of Bitcoin Futures in Dec 2017. Yes, the total trading volumes of the “risky” Bitcoin Futures is still low and won’t adversely affect price. However, according to the researchers and echoed by a Japanese economist, the reaction and the consequent sell off were consistent with how assets prices respond once Futures trading are availed.\nBitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis\nWeekly Chart\nBitcoin Weekly Chart by Trading View\nWeek over week, Bitcoin prices are registering greens for the first time in two months or so. The weeklies paint a clear picture for our assertion and even if this is what could spur further gains this week, we shall take a cautious approach. First, we should realize that this injection of momentum is happening at key supports: at $6,000.\nThis was our sell trigger in our previous analysis. Even though our shorts with stops at $6,800 are not yet live, it’s better to stay neutral and move them to break even depending on where you sold. The reason is simple: this might after all be short covering and a recovery after the expiration of June’s BTC Futures.\nThen again, this BTC recovery has low volumes inconsistent with strong recoveries. Besides, it didn’t conclude with a total reversal of week ending June 24 losses for a nice double bar bull reversal candlestick.\nDaily Chart\nBitcoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nThe bull injection of momentum at $6,000 is clear. Here there is a nice double bar bull reversal pattern with markedly high volumes and a follow through on June 30 confirming that indeed there is a shift in momentum.\nSo, swing traders can: either buy at current spot prices with stops at $5,550 or June 29 lows or buy once prices edge past $7,000 as we had mentioned before. The latter is a reserved but a sure method of verifying if indeed there has been a change of momentum.\nDisclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the author and aren’t investment advice.

302	Floods in China create Havoc for Cryptocurrency Miners	Floods in the Sichuan province in China due to the heavy rains on June 27th and June 28th had become so severe that cryptocurrency mining operations in the area were damaged. According to the miners, these repairs are ‘almost impossible’ to repair.\nChina has been booming regarding Bitcoin mining activities even though the government has maintained a strict stance on cryptocurrencies in the country. According to sources, China accounts for nearly 70% of the world’s Bitcoin mining activities, with Sichuan being declared ‘Bitcoin mining capital.’\nBitcoin mining needs cold temperatures due to the high computational operations which can thus take up high bills concerning electricity. Therefore colder climates are preferred to reduce electricity charges. Sichuan is also known to have lower electricity costs compared to other provinces in the country, which leads to many miners operating from Sichuan.\nThe Sichuan floods have thus reported having reduced the hashrate from 43 million TH/s to 30 million TH/s which is more than 30% overnight.\nEric Meltzer, a partner at INBlockchain which is the largest blockchain-focused fund in China reported that the destruction was pretty severe for mining operations in Sichuan.\nINBlockchain is known to be one of the most influential cryptocurrency investments firms in Asia especially China.\nEric Melter posted a picture of a damaged mining facility which would get any cryptocurrency miner crying given the stacks of ASIC miners that are seen affected.\n\nRumors that a huge flood in Sichuan took out a bunch of BTC mines pic.twitter.com/X6jNeAVDWm\n— Eric Meltzer (@wheatpond) June 29, 2018\n\nMeltzer, who is experienced in cryptocurrency pointed out that the Bitcoin hashrate drop is because of both the flood in Sichuan and the heatwave across Eastern Europe which is filled with mining centers too.\nA few weeks ago Brad Garlinghouse had accused China of controlling Bitcoin at the Intercontinental Boston due to its mining operations of Bitcoin.\nDo you think, the Chinese have a major impact on Bitcoin’s price and value given the strength of its mining operations?

321	Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Reversal Pattern and Breakout	Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\n\nBitcoin price staged a rally sharp enough to break past the falling trend line on the 4-hour chart.\nIn addition, a small double bottom has formed on this same time frame to signal that an uptrend is underway.\nTechnical indicators, however, are suggesting that the declines could still resume.\n\nBitcoin price broke past the descending trend line and the neckline of a small double bottom to signal a possible reversal.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA to indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This suggests that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse.\nThe shorter-term moving average appears to be holding as resistance for now, but a bullish flag also appears to have formed. This is typically seen as a continuation signal and a break higher could lead to a test of the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point. A break past this area could be enough to confirm that a longer-term uptrend is taking place.\nRSI is already turning lower from overbought levels to indicate that selling pressure is building up. Similarly stochastic is also pointing down to signal a return in selling pressure even without hitting overbought conditions. If bears return, bitcoin could still slump back below the trend line and resume the slide.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nBitcoin appears to be off to a fresh positive start so far this quarter and month as it staged a sharp rally. It may have also gotten a boost from bullish remarks by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes who predicted that it will reach $50,000 by the end of the year. He cited:\n“We could definitely find a bottom in the $3,000 to $5,000 range. But we’re one positive regulatory decision away, many an ETF approved by the SEC, to climbing through $20,000 and even to $50,000 by the end of the year.”\nHe added that the recent dips in price could encourage more investors with more capital to hop in at better levels.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Reversal Pattern and Breakout appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/02/bitcoin-btc-price-watch-reversal-pattern-and-breakout/	2018-07-02 03:55:12+00	0
322	Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Bullish Above $700	Key Points\n\nBitcoin cash price is positioned nicely above the $700 support with positive signs against the US Dollar.\nThere is a new declining channel formed with resistance near $740 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\nThe pair must clear the $740 and $750 resistance levels to move further higher in the bullish zone.\n\nBitcoin cash price is holding the $700 support against the US Dollar. BCH/USD must gain momentum above $750 to revisit the $800 resistance zone in the near term.\nBitcoin Cash Price Trend\nThere was a decent upside move above the $700 resistance in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The BCH/USD pair traded above the $760 resistance and almost tested the $800 level. A high was formed at $784 before the price started consolidating gains. It corrected lower and moved below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $649 low to $784 high.\nHowever, the decline was protected by the $720 support zone. More importantly, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $649 low to $784 high acted as a strong support. At the moment, it seems like there is a new declining channel formed with resistance near $740 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair is currently attempting an upside break above the $740 resistance. BCH buyers must clear the $740 and $750 resistance levels to take the price towards $800 in the near term.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price is placed nicely in a bullish zone above $700. An initial support is at $720, below which the price could retest the $700 support. Any further declines may perhaps push the price back in a bearish zone towards $650.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is currently flat in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is now above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $700\nMajor Resistance Level – $750\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Bullish Above $700 appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/02/bitcoin-cash-price-analysis-bch-usd-bullish-above-700/	2018-07-02 04:08:36+00	3
323	Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH/USD Could Break Higher	Key Highlights\n\nETH price is positioned nicely above the $438.00 and $435.00 support levels against the US Dollar.\nThere is a key contracting triangle formed with resistance near $455 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\nThe pair may perhaps break the triangle resistance to trade further higher towards $480.\n\nEthereum price is back in a positive zone against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ETH/USD has to clear the $455 resistance to stage more gains in the near term.\nEthereum Price Resistance\nRecently, there was a solid upside move above the $430 level in ETH price against the US Dollar. The ETH/USD pair broke the $445 and $450 resistance levels. It traded as high as $463.91 before starting a short-term consolidation. It corrected lower below the $450 level and broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $403 low to $463 high.\nHowever, the decline was protected by the $4404-441 support zone. Moreover, the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $403 low to $463 high also acted as a support. More importantly, there was no break below $438 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. At the moment, there is a key contracting triangle formed with resistance near $455 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair has to break the triangle resistance and then $460 to gain upside momentum. If buyers are successful, the price could test the $480 and $485 resistance levels.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price is supported near the triangle support at $446. A break below the mentioned support may ignite more declines towards the $438 level and the 100 hourly SMA. It must stay above the 100 hourly SMA to avoid a bearish reaction back towards the $430 and $425 levels in the near term.\nHourly MACD – The MACD is mostly neutral in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI – The RSI is currently flat above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $438\nMajor Resistance Level – $455\nThe post Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH/USD Could Break Higher appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/02/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-usd-could-break-higher/	2018-07-02 05:00:30+00	0
324	Cryptocurrency Market Update: 0x (ZRX) Surging 20% on Coinbase Rumors	FOMO Moments\nCrypto land is quiet; Zero-ex, Nem, Neo, and Verge doing well this morning.\nFollowing the pump from the lowest dip of the year on Friday, crypto markets have been relatively stable over the weekend. Total market capitalization has remained above $250 billion but further upward momentum could not be found. Better news is that they did not collapse again back to a deeper dip, though this could still be possible.\nBitcoin failed to break through key resistance at $6,400 and has fallen back marginally to $6,340 showing no gains or losses over the past 24 hours. Ethereum has also stalled at its current level of $450 forming a consolidating triangle according to the technical analysis. Altcoins are mostly in the green with some showing good gains this morning in Asia. These include Cardano, Iota, Neo, Nem, 0x and Verge.\nAccording to Coinmarketcap ADA, IOTA, NEO and NEM are the best performing altcoins in the top 25 all posting gains of just over 5% at the time of writing. All four of these however have taken the heaviest hits during the past month, falling harder than many of their digital brethren. It is usually the case that these ones are the first to bounce back after a big drop.\nFurther down the list one token making big moves at the moment is 0x. Zero-ex is currently up 20% on the day to trade at $0.91 from $0.76 this time yesterday. This decentralized exchange protocol has also suffered during the bear rout but is recovering quickly. 0z has made 38% over the past week climbing from $0.66 but is down 30% on the month falling from $1.28. Against BTC 0x is up 19.5% on the day to 14240 satoshis and over the week this token has made 32% on Bitcoin from 10800 satoshis.\n\nEventually decentralized exchanges, or DEXes, will rule crypto land and tokens such as 0x may be used to facilitate cross chain exchange. Being priced under a dollar makes ZRX a good altcoin to get into at the moment and traders are picking it up right now. There have also been unsubstantiated rumors of a Coinbase listing which always pumps an altcoin.\nBinance currently dominates ZRX trade with around 42% of the total volume. Bithumb and OKEx are also popular exchanges for this token. Total trade volume has actually fallen over the past 24 hours from $21 million to $17 million however signals are good and it is climbing again. 0x currently has a market cap of $480 million ranking it at 27th spot.\nTotal cryptocurrency market capitalization has remained flat over the past 24 hours at $255 billion. Likewise with volume which is currently around $14 billion. Markets are marginally higher than their $250 billion level this time last Monday but are still way down on the month. Aside from ZRX, Verge is making good gains today up 10% as is Populous and Status.\nMore on 0x can be found here: https://0xproject.com/\nFOMO Moments is a section that takes a daily look at the top 25 altcoins during the Asian trading session and analyses the best performing one, looking for trends and possible fundamentals.\nThe post Cryptocurrency Market Update: 0x (ZRX) Surging 20% on Coinbase Rumors appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/02/cryptocurrency-market-update-0x-zrx-surging-20-on-coinbase-rumors/	2018-07-02 05:15:50+00	4

326	Did Satoshi Reappear to Write a Bitcoin History Account?	The mystery of the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has been a topic of discussion in the cryptocurrency community for years after he/she/they mysteriously disappeared. But a website, created on June 29th, states that Satoshi is back.\nSatoshi Nakamoto: Bitcoin’s Decade-Long Mystery\nWho is Satoshi Nakamoto? That is the mystery that has plagued the cryptocurrency community for the better part of a decade. \nFor those who are unaware, Nakamoto is a pseudonymous name that has become integrally tied to the identity of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Speculation has raged about the true identity of the programmer who created the Bitcoin code base. Some say it is Craig Wright, an Australian coder who has claimed to be Nakamoto, others say its a collective group of like-minded individuals. But to this day, no one knows for sure.\nHowever, others have wondered if it is really necessary to figure out who Satoshi is, as Bitcoin was founded on decentralized principles. A lack of centralized figurehead only attests to the decentralized values Bitcoin was based upon.\nAfter 2011, Satoshi disappeared, along with a reported one million Bitcoin, leaving many to speculate where he went.  Since then, the mystery has remained, with talk of the ‘real’ Satoshi and ‘Faktoshi’ arriving on a monthly basis.\nThe Nakamoto Family Foundation Website\nHowever, the situation has unexpectedly developed, with a website claiming that Satoshi is back. The website, titled the Nakamoto Family Foundation, claims that Satoshi is writing an account of Bitcoin. The website notes:\n“I wanted the people and the facts to be known. Or as much of it. I’m still saving most for the books, the best parts hopefully.”\nKeeping Satoshi’s affection for cryptography in mind, the owner of the website, Nakamoto or not, added a puzzle for users willing to try. According to Bloomberg, the puzzle reveals the supposed title of the book, this being “Honne And Tatamae.” \nThe two words, staying in line with Satoshi’s Japanese pseudonymous identity, is a Japanese expression that has been translated to “the contrast between a person’s true feelings and desires” and “the behavior and opinions one displays in public.” \nAt the time of writing, it is unclear how the author of the website will tie in this concept into the book, which will cover facts and the history of Bitcoin. The website contains an excerpt from the book, which is still being written. The excerpt covers the apparent origins of Bitcoin, elaborating on the internal thoughts ‘Satoshi’ had regarding certain aspects of Bitcoin’s development process. \nAlthough surprisingly detailed, users still wondered if it really is Satoshi, or an impostor, playing an extremely elaborate scheme on the minds of the community.  \nBut Is It Really Satoshi?\nThe cryptocurrency community has gone into an outrage over this news, with many expressing that there is no way this can be Satoshi. Upon analysis of the website, many Bitcoin community members said that Satoshi could easily identify himself. Whether it be through a digital signature unique to Satoshi, or by making a Bitcoin transaction from one of Satoshi’s many addresses. \nAdditionally, some pointed out that the writing of the apparent book excerpt was of low quality, and in a different style than the original whitepaper, which was released in 2008.\nA Reddit user with the handle, John_The_Cashist, said:\n\n\n\n“Wow, Nakamoto’s writing really went downhill following the publication of his white paper.”\nThese reasons, along with a multitude of others, have led the community to widely believe that there is no way this is really Satoshi. But if Satoshi is still out there, alive and well, a book regarding the history of Bitcoin would be widely welcomed.\n\n\n\n \nImage from Shutterstock\nThe post Did Satoshi Reappear to Write a Bitcoin History Account? appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/02/did-satoshi-reappear-to-write-a-bitcoin-history-account/	2018-07-02 06:00:50+00	0
327	Ripple Price Analysis: Can XRP/USD Surpass $0.4750?	Key Highlights\n\nRipple price recovered from the $0.4248 low, but it failed to settle above $0.4750 against the US dollar.\nThere is a short-term declining channel in place with resistance at $0.4650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).\nThe pair must clear the $0.4650 and $0.4750 resistance levels to recover further in the near term.\n\nRipple price struggled near key resistance levels against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. XRP/USD must settle above the $0.4750 barrier for more upsides towards $0.5000.\nRipple Price Resistance\nThis past week, Ripple price traded towards the $0.4200 support area against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair traded as low as $0.4248 before buyers appeared. A fresh upward wave was initiated and the price moved above the $0.4500 and $0.4600 resistance levels. The price traded as high as $0.4817, but buyers fail to keep the price above the $0.4750 resistance.\nXRP price declined and broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the wave from the $0.4248 low to $0.4817 high. However, the decline was protected by the $0.4500-20 support area. More importantly, there was no close below the 50% Fib retracement level of the wave from the $0.4248 low to $0.4817 high. At the moment, it seems like there is a short-term declining channel in place with resistance at $0.4650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair is attempting an upside break above the $0.4620-50 resistance zone.

330	Kraken Claims Bloomberg is Manipulating Bitcoin Futures Market	Crypto exchange Kraken has responded to a recent article by Bloomberg that argues Tether (USDT) is being manipulated on their exchange. Kraken took a dig at the article’s complex headline and insinuated that the article was written to have an effect on the price of futures trading.\nKraken Swipes at Bloomberg\nFour Bloomberg reporters claimed that data from Tether trading on Kraken showed two red flags for regulators on June 29. Today, Kraken argued the article was badly written, defied logic, and was shamelessly copied by other ‘journalist lemmings.’ In response to claims that the exchange is involved in market manipulation, they suggested that Bloomberg have their own incentives for the piece to be written.\nKraken said, in a statement:\n“If we are to take up our pitchforks against market manipulation, guide your torches toward this illumination: the Bloomberg News piece was published on June 29th, the last business day of trading for Q2, and expiration date of numerous futures contracts. It raises red flags.”\nKraken was presumably referring to the CME futures trading which ended on June 29 with a settlement date of July 5. Futures trading is where two traders agree to sell an asset between them at a fixed price in the future, essentially betting if it will go up (long) or down (short). Kraken is implying that the article could have dropped the price of Bitcoin, making profits for those who had shorted it.\nResponse to Tether Manipulation\nThe Bloomberg article made two allegations against Tether trading on the Kraken exchange using data provided by Kraken. It claimed that some small trades made a bigger difference in the price of Tether than larger trades. It also pointed out that a high number of trades are made with specific order sizes that are unlikely to be made by humans.\nThe article said: “Unlike the price of Bitcoin, which fluctuates in tandem with shifts in trading volume, the price of Tether is inconsistently changed by large and small orders to buy or sell the coin.”\nKraken responded to the first claim by stating that Tether is backed one-to-one by the US dollar. This is what makes is different from Bitcoin, which has a price based purely on supply and demand. After questioning why someone would spend time wash trading a pegged asset against its peg, they put in a dig at the US dollar which they claimed ‘is an explicitly manipulated asset.’\nIn response to smaller trades having a greater effect on the price of Tether, Kraken humbly admitted that although they are proud of their reputation, they are not big enough to determine the price of USDT. Kraken said:\n“This level of USDT price discovery happens on markets with hundreds of millions of dollars of volume, not on Kraken’s USDT/USD market, which has currently traded less than $1 million in the last 24 hours.”\nKraken only offered three words in response to the second claim after they spoke to the trader responsible for the orders of 13076.389 USDT which accounted for ‘7.9% of total trading activity on Tether between May 1–June 22′ according to Bloomberg. The trader told Kraken the number was ‘literally randomly selected.’\n \nbloom\nThe post Kraken Claims Bloomberg is Manipulating Bitcoin Futures Market appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/02/kraken-claims-bloomberg-is-manipulating-bitcoin-futures-market/	2018-07-02 07:30:26+00	0

333	Cardano Price Analysis: ADA/USD Showing Positive Signs	Key Highlights\n\nADA price remains supported above the $0.1350 pivot area against the US Dollar (tethered).\nThere is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $0.1450 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data feed via Bittrex).\nA break above the $0.1450 and $0.1500 resistance levels may open the doors for more gains.\n\nCardano price is back in a positive zone against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ADA/USD remains in an uptrend as long as it is above the $0.1250 support level.\nCardano Price Analysis\nThis past week, there was a major downside move below $0.1250 in ADA price against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair traded towards the $0.1100 level and formed a low at $0.1133. Later, there was an upside move and the price jumped above the $0.1300 resistance level. It even tested the $0.1450 resistance zone and is currently placed well above the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nA high was formed at $0.1458 and the price is currently correcting lower. An initial support is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $0.1133 low to $0.1458 high. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $0.1450 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The triangle support is at $0.1350, which could play an important role in the near term. Below this, the price could test the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $0.1133 low to $0.1458 high around $0.1290.\n\nThe chart indicates that the price is well supported above the $0.1300 and $0.1250 levels. To initiate more gains, the price has to move above the $0.1450 and $0.1500 resistance levels. Above this last, the next stop for buyers could be around the $0.1650 level.\nHourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is slowly moving back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI – The RSI for ADA/USD is moving lower towards the 50 level with neutral signs.\nMajor Support Level – $0.1300\nMajor Resistance Level – $0.1450\nThe post Cardano Price Analysis: ADA/USD Showing Positive Signs appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/02/cardano-price-analysis-ada-usd-positive-signs/	2018-07-02 08:30:07+00	1
334	Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Forming Bull Flag	Key Points\n\nBitcoin price remained well supported above the $6,200 support area against the US Dollar.\nThere is a bullish flag pattern forming with support at $6,260 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\nA break above the $6,400 level may perhaps open the doors for a fresh upward wave.\n\nBitcoin price is trading in a bullish zone above $6,200 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must break the $6,400 and $6,500 resistance levels to climb further higher.\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nThere was a sharp upside move from the $5,800 swing low in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair climbed above the $6,000 and $6,400 resistance levels. It traded as high as $6,527 and is currently correcting lower. The price started a downside correction and broke the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $5,794 low to $6,527 high.\nHowever, the decline was protected by the $6,250 level, which was a resistance earlier. Moreover, the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $5,794 low to $6,527 high also acted as a support. At the moment, there is a bullish flag pattern forming with support at $6,260 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The flag support is near the $6,250 level. Below this, the price could test the $6,200 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. If the flag pattern plays well, the price might resume its upside move by clearing the $6,400 resistance. The next hurdles are at $6,500 and $6,600.\n\nLooking at the chart, the price must stay above the $6,200 support for an upside move. If not, there is a risk of a downside move back towards $6,000. The overall price action is positive with chances of a bullish break above $6,400.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is just below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $6,200\nMajor Resistance Level – $6,400\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Forming Bull Flag appeared first on NewsBTC.	2	https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/07/02/bitcoin-price-watch-btc-usd-forming-bull-flag/	2018-07-02 08:38:29+00	0
